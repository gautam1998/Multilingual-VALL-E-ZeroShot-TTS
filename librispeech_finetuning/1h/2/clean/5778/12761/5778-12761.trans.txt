5778-12761-0000 CONTINUATION OF FREMONT'S ACCOUNT OF THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS WE HAD HARD AND DOUBTFUL LABOR YET BEFORE US AS THE SNOW APPEARED TO BE HEAVIER WHERE THE TIMBER BEGAN FURTHER DOWN WITH FEW OPEN SPOTS
5778-12761-0001 ASCENDING A HEIGHT WE TRACED OUT THE BEST LINE WE COULD DISCOVER FOR THE NEXT DAY'S MARCH AND HAD AT LEAST THE CONSOLATION TO SEE THAT THE MOUNTAIN DESCENDED RAPIDLY THE DAY HAD BEEN ONE OF APRIL GUSTY WITH A FEW OCCASIONAL FLAKES OF SNOW
5778-12761-0002 WHICH IN THE AFTERNOON ENVELOPED THE UPPER MOUNTAINS IN CLOUDS WE WATCHED THEM ANXIOUSLY AS NOW WE DREADED A SNOW STORM SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WE HEARD THE ROLL OF THUNDER AND LOOKING TOWARD THE VALLEY FOUND IT ALL ENVELOPED IN A THUNDERSTORM
5778-12761-0003 FOR US AS CONNECTED WITH THE IDEA OF SUMMER IT HAD A SINGULAR CHARM AND WE WATCHED ITS PROGRESS WITH EXCITED FEELINGS UNTIL NEARLY SUNSET
5778-12761-0004 WHEN THE SKY CLEARED OFF BRIGHTLY AND WE SAW A SHINING LINE OF WATER DIRECTING ITS COURSE TOWARDS ANOTHER A BROADER AND LARGER SHEET WE KNEW THAT THESE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE SACRAMENTO AND THE BAY OF SAN FRANCISCO
5778-12761-0005 BUT AFTER OUR LONG WANDERING IN RUGGED MOUNTAINS WHERE SO FREQUENTLY WE HAD MET WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS AND WHERE THE CROSSING OF EVERY RIDGE DISPLAYED SOME UNKNOWN LAKE OR RIVER
5778-12761-0006 WE WERE YET ALMOST AFRAID TO BELIEVE THAT WE WERE AT LAST TO ESCAPE INTO THE GENIAL COUNTRY OF WHICH WE HAVE HEARD SO MANY GLOWING DESCRIPTIONS AND DREADED AGAIN TO FIND SOME VAST INTERIOR LAKE WHOSE BITTER WATERS WOULD BRING US DISAPPOINTMENT
5778-12761-0007 ON THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE BAY COULD BE TRACED THE GLEAMING LINE WHERE ENTERED ANOTHER LARGE STREAM AND AGAIN THE BUENAVENTURA ROSE UP IN OUR MIND
5778-12761-0008 CARSON HAD ENTERED THE VALLEY ALONG THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE BAY BUT THE COUNTRY THEN WAS SO ENTIRELY COVERED WITH WATER FROM SNOW AND RAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO FORM NO CORRECT IMPRESSION OF WATERCOURSES
5778-12761-0009 WE HAD THE SATISFACTION TO KNOW THAT AT LEAST THERE WERE PEOPLE BELOW FIRES WERE LIT UP IN THE VALLEY JUST AT NIGHT APPEARING TO BE IN ANSWER TO OURS AND THESE SIGNS OF LIFE RENEWED IN SOME MEASURE THE GAYETY OF THE CAMP
5778-12761-0010 THEY APPEARED SO NEAR THAT WE JUDGED THEM TO BE AMONG THE TIMBER OF SOME OF THE NEIGHBORING RIDGES BUT HAVING THEM CONSTANTLY IN VIEW DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THEM TO BE FIRES THAT HAD BEEN KINDLED BY THE INDIANS AMONG THE TULARES
