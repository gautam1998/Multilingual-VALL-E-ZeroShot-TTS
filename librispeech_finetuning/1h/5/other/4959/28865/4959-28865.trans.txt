4959-28865-0001 HE ISN'T HERE SAID SILVERBRIDGE WHO DID NOT WISH TO BE INTERRUPTED BY HIS RACING FRIEND YOUR FATHER I BELIEVE SAID TIFTO HE WAS RED IN THE FACE BUT WAS IN OTHER RESPECTS PERHAPS IMPROVED IN APPEARANCE BY HIS LIQUOR
4959-28865-0002 IN HIS MORE SOBER MOMENTS HE WAS NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO ASSUME THAT APPEARANCE OF EQUALITY WITH HIS COMPANIONS WHICH IT WAS THE AMBITION OF HIS SOUL TO ACHIEVE BUT A SECOND GLASS OF WHISKY AND WATER
4959-28865-0003 WOULD ALWAYS ENABLE HIM TO COCK HIS TAIL AND BARK BEFORE THE COMPANY WITH ALL THE COURAGE OF MY LADY'S PUG WOULD YOU DO ME THE GREAT HONOUR TO INTRODUCE ME TO HIS GRACE
4959-28865-0004 SILVERBRIDGE WAS NOT PRONE TO TURN HIS BACK UPON A FRIEND BECAUSE HE WAS LOW IN THE WORLD HE HAD BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE BY CONNECTING HIMSELF WITH THE MAJOR BUT AT THE CLUB HE ALWAYS DEFENDED HIS PARTNER
4959-28865-0005 THOUGH HE NOT UNFREQUENTLY FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO SNUB THE MAJOR HIMSELF HE ALWAYS COUNTENANCED THE LITTLE MASTER OF HOUNDS AND WAS TRUE TO HIS OWN IDEA OF STANDING TO A FELLOW
