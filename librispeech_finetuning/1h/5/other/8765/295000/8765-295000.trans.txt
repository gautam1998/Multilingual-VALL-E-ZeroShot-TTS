8765-295000-0000 CHAPTER FIVE THE SEAL AND THE BEAR YOU KNOW DOCTOR SAID HATTERAS AS THEY RETURNED TO THE HUT THE POLAR BEARS SUBSIST ALMOST ENTIRELY ON SEALS THEY'LL LIE IN WAIT FOR THEM BESIDE THE CREVASSES FOR WHOLE DAYS
8765-295000-0001 READY TO STRANGLE THEM THE MOMENT THEIR HEADS APPEAR ABOVE THE SURFACE IT IS NOT LIKELY THEN THAT A BEAR WILL BE FRIGHTENED OF A SEAL I THINK I SEE WHAT YOU ARE AFTER BUT IT IS DANGEROUS
8765-295000-0002 YES BUT THERE IS MORE CHANCE OF SUCCESS THAN IN TRYING ANY OTHER PLAN SO I MEAN TO RISK IT I AM GOING TO DRESS MYSELF IN THE SEAL'S SKIN AND CREEP ALONG THE ICE COME DON'T LET US LOSE TIME LOAD THE GUN AND GIVE IT ME
8765-295000-0003 THE DOCTOR COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING FOR HE WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME HIMSELF SO HE FOLLOWED HATTERAS SILENTLY TO THE SLEDGE TAKING WITH HIM A COUPLE OF HATCHETS FOR HIS OWN AND JOHNSON'S USE HATTERAS SOON MADE HIS TOILETTE AND SLIPPED INTO THE SKIN
8765-295000-0004 NOW THEN GIVE ME THE GUN HE SAID
8765-295000-0005 COURAGE HATTERAS SAID THE DOCTOR HANDING HIM THE WEAPON WHICH HE HAD CAREFULLY LOADED MEANWHILE NEVER FEAR BUT BE SURE YOU DON'T SHOW YOURSELVES TILL I FIRE THE DOCTOR SOON JOINED THE OLD BOATSWAIN BEHIND THE HUMMOCK AND TOLD HIM WHAT THEY HAD BEEN DOING
8765-295000-0006 THE BEAR WAS STILL THERE BUT MOVING RESTLESSLY ABOUT AS IF HE FELT THE APPROACH OF DANGER IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR SO THE SEAL MADE HIS APPEARANCE ON THE ICE HE HAD GONE A GOOD WAY ROUND SO AS TO COME ON THE BEAR BY SURPRISE
8765-295000-0007 AND EVERY MOVEMENT WAS SO PERFECT AN IMITATION OF A SEAL THAT EVEN THE DOCTOR WOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN IT WAS HATTERAS IT IS CAPITAL SAID JOHNSON IN A LOW VOICE THE BEAR HAD INSTANTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE SUPPOSED SEAL FOR HE GATHERED HIMSELF UP
8765-295000-0008 PREPARING TO MAKE A SPRING AS THE ANIMAL CAME NEARER
8765-295000-0009 BRUIN WENT TO WORK WITH EXTREME PRUDENCE THOUGH HIS EYES GLARED WITH GREEDY DESIRE TO CLUTCH THE COVETED PREY FOR HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN FASTING A MONTH IF NOT TWO HE ALLOWED HIS VICTIM TO GET WITHIN TEN PACES OF HIM AND THEN SPRANG FORWARD WITH A TREMENDOUS BOUND
8765-295000-0010 BUT STOPPED SHORT STUPEFIED AND FRIGHTENED WITHIN THREE STEPS OF HATTERAS WHO STARTED UP THAT MOMENT AND THROWING OFF HIS DISGUISE KNELT ON ONE KNEE AND AIMED STRAIGHT AT THE BEAR'S HEART
8765-295000-0011 HURRYING TOWARDS HATTERAS FOR THE BEAR HAD REARED ON HIS HIND LEGS AND WAS STRIKING THE AIR WITH ONE PAW AND TEARING UP THE SNOW TO STANCH HIS WOUND WITH THE OTHER HATTERAS NEVER MOVED BUT WAITED KNIFE IN HAND
8765-295000-0012 HE HAD AIMED WELL AND FIRED WITH A SURE AND STEADY AIM BEFORE EITHER OF HIS COMPANIONS CAME UP HE HAD PLUNGED THE KNIFE IN THE ANIMAL'S THROAT AND MADE AN END OF HIM FOR HE FELL DOWN AT ONCE TO RISE NO MORE
