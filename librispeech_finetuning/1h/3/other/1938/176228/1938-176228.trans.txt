1938-176228-0000 CHAPTER NINE THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKET I PULLED UP SHARPLY AS IF A BRAKE HAD BEEN SUDDENLY AND EVEN MERCILESSLY APPLIED TO BRING ME TO A STANDSTILL
1938-176228-0001 IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW I STOOD SHIVERING A SHOWER HAD RECENTLY COMMENCED THE FALLING RAIN WAS BEING BLOWN BEFORE THE BREEZE I WAS IN A TERRIBLE SWEAT YET TREMULOUS AS WITH COLD COVERED WITH MUD
1938-176228-0002 BRUISED AND CUT AND BLEEDING AS PITEOUS AN OBJECT AS YOU WOULD CARE TO SEE EVERY LIMB IN MY BODY ACHED EVERY MUSCLE WAS EXHAUSTED MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY I WAS DONE
1938-176228-0003 HAD I NOT BEEN HELD UP WILLY NILLY BY THE SPELL WHICH WAS UPON ME I SHOULD HAVE SUNK DOWN THEN AND THERE IN A HOPELESS HELPLESS HAPLESS HEAP BUT MY TORMENTOR WAS NOT YET AT AN END WITH ME
1938-176228-0004 AS I STOOD THERE LIKE SOME BROKEN AND BEATEN HACK WAITING FOR THE WORD OF COMMAND IT CAME IT WAS AS IF SOME STRONG MAGNETIC CURRENT HAD BEEN SWITCHED ON TO ME THROUGH THE WINDOW TO DRAW ME INTO THE ROOM
1938-176228-0005 OVER THE LOW WALL I WENT OVER THE SILL ONCE MORE I STOOD IN THAT CHAMBER OF MY HUMILIATION AND MY SHAME AND ONCE AGAIN I WAS CONSCIOUS OF THAT AWFUL SENSE OF THE PRESENCE OF AN EVIL THING
1938-176228-0006 HOW MUCH OF IT WAS FACT AND HOW MUCH OF IT WAS THE PRODUCT OF IMAGINATION I CANNOT SAY BUT LOOKING BACK IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT WAS AS IF I HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE CORPOREAL BODY
1938-176228-0007 THERE WAS THE SOUND OF SOMETHING FLOPPING FROM OFF THE BED ON TO THE GROUND AND I KNEW THAT THE THING WAS COMING AT ME ACROSS THE FLOOR MY STOMACH QUAKED MY HEART MELTED WITHIN ME
1938-176228-0008 THE VERY ANGUISH OF MY TERROR GAVE ME STRENGTH TO SCREAM AND SCREAM SOMETIMES EVEN NOW I SEEM TO HEAR THOSE SCREAMS OF MINE RINGING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND I BURY MY FACE IN THE PILLOW
1938-176228-0009 AND IT IS AS THOUGH I WAS PASSING THROUGH THE VERY VALLEY OF THE SHADOW THE THING WENT BACK I COULD HEAR IT SLIPPING AND SLIDING ACROSS THE FLOOR THERE WAS SILENCE AND PRESENTLY THE LAMP WAS LIT
1938-176228-0010 AND THE ROOM WAS ALL IN BRIGHTNESS THERE ON THE BED IN THE FAMILIAR ATTITUDE BETWEEN THE SHEETS HIS HEAD RESTING ON HIS HAND HIS EYES BLAZING LIKE LIVING COALS WAS THE DREADFUL CAUSE OF ALL MY AGONIES
