4406-16882-0000 BELONGING TO OUR GARRISON BUT NONE OF THEM WOULD STIR THOUGH ANOTHER TIME IF ANY INDIAN HAD COME TO THE DOOR THEY WERE READY TO FLY UPON HIM AND TEAR HIM DOWN THE LORD HEREBY WOULD MAKE US THE MORE ACKNOWLEDGE HIS HAND AND TO SEE THAT OUR HELP IS ALWAYS IN HIM
4406-16882-0001 BUT OUT WE MUST GO THE FIRE INCREASING AND COMING ALONG BEHIND US ROARING AND THE INDIANS GAPING BEFORE US WITH THEIR GUNS SPEARS AND HATCHETS TO DEVOUR US
4406-16882-0002 IN OR NEAR THE THROAT FELL DOWN DEAD WHEREAT THE INDIANS SCORNFULLY SHOUTED AND HALLOWED AND WERE PRESENTLY UPON HIM STRIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES THE BULLETS FLYING THICK ONE WENT THROUGH MY SIDE AND THE SAME AS WOULD SEEM
4406-16882-0003 THROUGH THE BOWELS AND HAND OF MY DEAR CHILD IN MY ARMS ONE OF MY ELDER SISTERS CHILDREN NAMED WILLIAM HAD THEN HIS LEG BROKEN WHICH THE INDIANS PERCEIVING THEY KNOCKED HIM ON HIS HEAD
4406-16882-0004 STANDING AMAZED WITH THE BLOOD RUNNING DOWN TO OUR HEELS MY ELDEST SISTER BEING YET IN THE HOUSE AND SEEING THOSE WOEFUL SIGHTS THE INFIDELS HAULING MOTHERS ONE WAY AND CHILDREN ANOTHER AND SOME WALLOWING IN THEIR BLOOD
4406-16882-0005 AND HER ELDER SON TELLING HER THAT HER SON WILLIAM WAS DEAD AND MYSELF WAS WOUNDED SHE SAID AND LORD LET ME DIE WITH THEM WHICH WAS NO SOONER SAID BUT SHE WAS STRUCK WITH A BULLET AND FELL DOWN DEAD OVER THE THRESHOLD
4406-16882-0006 I HOPE SHE IS REAPING THE FRUIT OF HER GOOD LABORS BEING FAITHFUL TO THE SERVICE OF GOD IN HER PLACE IN HER YOUNGER YEARS SHE LAY UNDER MUCH TROUBLE UPON SPIRITUAL ACCOUNTS TILL IT PLEASED GOD TO MAKE THAT PRECIOUS SCRIPTURE TAKE HOLD OF HER HEART AND HE SAID UNTO ME
4406-16882-0007 OH THE DOLEFUL SIGHT THAT NOW WAS TO BEHOLD AT THIS HOUSE COME BEHOLD THE WORKS OF THE LORD
4406-16882-0008 AND RELATIONS LIE BLEEDING OUT THEIR HEART BLOOD UPON THE GROUND THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS CHOPPED INTO THE HEAD WITH A HATCHET AND STRIPPED NAKED
4406-16882-0009 AS IF THEY WOULD HAVE TORN OUR VERY HEARTS OUT YET THE LORD BY HIS ALMIGHTY POWER PRESERVED A NUMBER OF US FROM DEATH FOR THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR OF US TAKEN ALIVE AND CARRIED CAPTIVE I HAD OFTEN BEFORE THIS SAID THAT IF THE INDIANS SHOULD COME
4406-16882-0010 I SHOULD CHOOSE RATHER TO BE KILLED BY THEM THAN TAKEN ALIVE BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE TRIAL MY MIND CHANGED THEIR GLITTERING WEAPONS SO DAUNTED MY SPIRIT THAT I CHOSE RATHER TO GO ALONG WITH THOSE AS I MAY SAY RAVENOUS BEASTS
4406-16882-0011 THAN THAT MOMENT TO END MY DAYS AND THAT I MAY THE BETTER DECLARE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME DURING THAT GRIEVOUS CAPTIVITY I SHALL PARTICULARLY SPEAK OF THE SEVERAL REMOVES WE HAD UP AND DOWN THE WILDERNESS THE FIRST REMOVE NOW AWAY WE MUST GO WITH THOSE BARBAROUS CREATURES
4406-16882-0012 WITH OUR BODIES WOUNDED AND BLEEDING AND OUR HEARTS NO LESS THAN OUR BODIES ABOUT A MILE WE WENT THAT NIGHT UP UPON A HILL WITHIN SIGHT OF THE TOWN WHERE THEY INTENDED TO LODGE THERE WAS HARD BY A VACANT HOUSE DESERTED BY THE ENGLISH BEFORE FOR FEAR OF THE INDIANS
