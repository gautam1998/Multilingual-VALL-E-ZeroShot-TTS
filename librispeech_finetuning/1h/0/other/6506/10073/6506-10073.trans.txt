6506-10073-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN DICK TAKES HIS FINAL LEAVE
6506-10073-0001 HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFIED WITH IT
6506-10073-0002 BUT THE LADY SEEMED TO HESITATE AND ASKED FOR A WEEK TO THINK ABOUT IT THIS SHOWED SO MUCH INGRATITUDE ON HER PART WAS SO POOR AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE POSITION WHICH HE HAD OFFERED HER THAT HE WAS INCLINED TO BE INDIGNANT
6506-10073-0003 IF SHE DON'T CARE ABOUT IT SHE SHA'N'T HAVE IT IT WAS THUS THAT HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF ALOUD IN THE HEARING OF DICK ROSS BUT WITHOUT HOWEVER EXPLAINING WHO THE SHE WAS OR WHAT THE IT WAS OR INDEED IN ANY WAY ASKING DICK'S OPINION ON THE MATTER
6506-10073-0004 HAD SHE EXPRESSED HER WARM AFFECTION AND AT ONCE ACCEPTED ALL THAT HAD BEEN PROFFERED THE GENTLEMAN WOULD PROBABLY HAVE LEARNT AT ONCE TO DESPISE THAT WHICH HAD BEEN OBTAINED SO EASILY AS IT WAS HE WAS SIMPLY CROSS AND THOUGHT THAT HE HAD DETERMINED TO WITHDRAW THE PROPOSAL
6506-10073-0005 BUT STILL THE OTHER LETTER WAS TO COME AND MISS ALTIFIORLA'S CHANCE WAS STILL OPEN TO HER THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF THESE DOUBTS IN THE MIND OF SIR FRANCIS WAS A POSTPONEMENT OF THE VERDICT OF BANISHMENT WHICH HE HAD RESOLVED TO PRONOUNCE AGAINST DICK
6506-10073-0006 AS SOON AS HIS MARRIAGE WITH MISS ALTIFIORLA SHOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED HE DID NOT WISH TO LEAVE HIMSELF ALTOGETHER ALONE IN THE WORLD AND IF THIS DICK WERE DISMISSED IT WOULD BE NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH ANOTHER UNLESS HE WERE MINDED TO PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH A WIFE INSTEAD
6506-10073-0007 HE BECAME THEREFORE GRADUALLY MORE GRACIOUS AFTER THE LITTLE SPEECH WHICH HAS BEEN ABOVE GIVEN DICK HAD UNDERSTOOD PERFECTLY WHO THE SHE HAD BEEN
6506-10073-0008 AS NO QUESTION HAD BEEN ASKED HE HAD MADE NO REPLY
6506-10073-0009 HE DESPISED THE BARONET ALMOST AS THOROUGHLY AS DID MISTER WESTERN BUT FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES AS TO WHICH HE DESPISED HIMSELF ALSO THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE BARONET SUITED HIM JUST AT PRESENT ONE MORNING FOR PRIVATE REASONS OF HIS OWN
6506-10073-0010 DICK WENT INTO PERTH WHICH WAS TWENTY MILES DISTANT FROM THE BARONET'S SHOOTING LODGE AND RETURNED THE SAME DAY BRINGING THE POSTBAG WITH HIM FROM A POINT IN THE ROAD AT WHICH IT WAS DAILY LEFT BY THE POSTMAN SIR FRANCIS WITH UNUSUAL HASTE READ HIS LETTERS
6506-10073-0011 AND AMONG THEM WAS ONE FROM MISS ALTIFIORLA BUT DICK HAD A BUDGET OF NEWS WHICH HE WAS ANXIOUS TO REVEAL AND WHICH HE DID TELL BEFORE SIR FRANCIS HAD SAID ANYTHING AS TO HIS OWN LETTER THERE WAS ANOTHER FRIEND ONE CAPTAIN FAWKES AT THE LODGE WITH THEM
6506-10073-0012 AND DICK HAD AT FIRST BEEN RESTRAINED BY THIS MAN'S PRESENCE AS SOON AS HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE WITH SIR FRANCIS HE BEGAN LADY GRANT HAS GONE OFF TO DRESDEN HE SAID WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT ASKED THE BARONET THEY TOLD ME SO AT THE CLUB
6506-10073-0013 AND WHY WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF THEIRS SINCE YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT WHY HAS SHE GONE TO PERSUADE HER BROTHER TO COME HOME AND TAKE HIS WIFE ONCE MORE IT WAS AN INFERNAL SHAME THAT THEY SHOULD EVER HAVE BEEN SEPARATED
