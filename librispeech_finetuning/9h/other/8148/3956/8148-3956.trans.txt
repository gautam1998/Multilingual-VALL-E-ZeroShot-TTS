8148-3956-0000 MANY PEOPLE HAD RECOVERED THROUGH HIS EXORCISMS IF ADDED THE FRIEND THE DISEASE IS NEGLECTED IT BECOMES SERIOUS TRY THEREFORE THIS METHOD OF PROCURING RELIEF AT ONCE AND BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE
8148-3956-0001 GENJI THEREFORE SENT FOR THE HERMIT BUT HE DECLINED TO COME SAYING THAT HE WAS TOO OLD AND DECREPIT TO LEAVE HIS RETREAT WHAT SHALL I DO EXCLAIMED GENJI SHALL I VISIT HIM PRIVATELY EVENTUALLY
8148-3956-0002 TAKING FOUR OR FIVE ATTENDANTS HE STARTED OFF EARLY ONE MORNING FOR THE PLACE WHICH WAS AT NO GREAT DISTANCE ON THE MOUNTAIN IT WAS THE LAST DAY OF MARCH AND THOUGH THE HEIGHT OF THE SEASON FOR FLOWERS IN THE CAPITAL WAS OVER YET
8148-3956-0003 ON THE MOUNTAIN THE CHERRY TREES WERE STILL IN BLOSSOM THEY ADVANCED ON THEIR WAY FURTHER AND FURTHER THE HAZE CLUNG TO THE SURFACE LIKE A SOFT SASH DOES ROUND THE WAIST AND TO GENJI WHO HAD SCARCELY EVER BEEN OUT OF THE CAPITAL
8148-3956-0004 THE SCENERY WAS INDESCRIBABLY NOVEL THE ASCETIC LIVED IN A DEEP CAVE IN THE ROCKS NEAR THE LOFTY SUMMIT GENJI DID NOT HOWEVER DECLARE WHO HE WAS AND THE STYLE OF HIS RETINUE WAS OF A VERY PRIVATE CHARACTER
8148-3956-0005 YET HIS NOBILITY OF MANNERS WAS EASILY RECOGNIZABLE WELCOME YOUR VISIT CRIED THE HERMIT SALUTING HIM PERHAPS YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SENT FOR ME THE OTHER DAY I HAVE LONG SINCE QUITTED THE AFFAIRS OF THIS WORLD
8148-3956-0006 AND HAVE ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE SECRET OF MY EXORCISMS I WONDER WHY YOU HAVE COME HERE FOR ME SO SAYING HE PLEASINGLY EMBRACED HIM HE WAS EVIDENTLY A MAN OF GREAT HOLINESS HE WROTE OUT A TALISMANIC PRESCRIPTION
8148-3956-0007 WHILE HE HIMSELF PROCEEDED TO PERFORM SOME MYSTERIOUS RITE DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS CEREMONY THE SUN ROSE HIGH IN THE HEAVENS GENJI MEANTIME WALKED OUT OF THE CAVE AND LOOKED AROUND HIM WITH HIS ATTENDANTS THE SPOT WHERE THEY STOOD WAS VERY LOFTY
8148-3956-0008 AND NUMEROUS MONASTERIES WERE VISIBLE SCATTERED HERE AND THERE IN THE DISTANCE BENEATH THERE WAS IMMEDIATELY BEYOND THE WINDING PATH IN WHICH THEY WERE WALKING A PICTURESQUE AND PRETTY BUILDING ENCLOSED BY HEDGES ITS WELL ARRANGED BALCONIES AND THE GARDENS AROUND IT
8148-3956-0009 APPARENTLY BETOKENED THE GOOD TASTE OF ITS INHABITANTS WHOSE HOUSE MAY THAT BE INQUIRED GENJI OF HIS ATTENDANTS THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS A HOUSE IN WHICH A CERTAIN PRIEST HAD BEEN LIVING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AH I KNOW HIM SAID GENJI
8148-3956-0010 STRANGE INDEED WOULD IT BE IF HE WERE TO DISCOVER THAT I AM HERE IN THIS PRIVACY THEY NOTICED A NUN AND A FEW MORE FEMALES WITH HER WALKING IN THE GARDEN WHO WERE CARRYING FRESH WATER FOR THEIR OFFERINGS AND WERE GATHERING FLOWERS
8148-3956-0011 CRIED THE ATTENDANTS IN TONES OF SURPRISE SURELY THE REVEREND FATHER WOULD NOT INDULGE IN FLIRTATIONS WHO CAN THEY BE AND SOME OF THEM EVEN DESCENDED A LITTLE DISTANCE AND PEERED OVER THE ENCLOSURE WHERE A PRETTY LITTLE GIRL WAS ALSO SEEN AMONGST THEM
8148-3956-0012 GENJI NOW ENGAGED IN PRAYER UNTIL THE SUN SANK IN THE HEAVENS HIS ATTENDANTS WHO WERE ANXIOUS ABOUT HIS DISEASE TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR HIM TO HAVE A CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME HEREUPON HE ADVANCED TO THE BACK OF THE TEMPLE
8148-3956-0013 AND HIS GAZE FELL ON THE FAR OFF CAPITAL IN THE DISTANCE WHICH WAS ENVELOPED IN HAZE AS THE DUSK WAS SETTING IN OVER THE TOPS OF THE TREES AROUND WHAT A LOVELY LANDSCAPE EXCLAIMED GENJI THE PEOPLE TO WHOM SUCH SCENERY IS FAMILIAR
8148-3956-0014 ARE PERHAPS HAPPY AND CONTENTED NAY SAID THE ATTENDANTS BUT WERE YOU TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN RANGES AND THE SEA COAST IN OUR VARIOUS PROVINCES THE PICTURES WOULD INDEED BE FOUND LOVELY THEN
8148-3956-0015 SOME OF THEM DESCRIBED TO HIM FUJI YAMA WHILE OTHERS TOLD HIM OF OTHER MOUNTAINS
8148-3956-0016 THUS AS THEY DEPICTED THEM TO HIM THEY CHEERED AND GLADDENED HIS MIND ONE OF THEM WENT ON TO SAY AMONG SUCH SIGHTS AND AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE IS THE SEA COAST OF AKASHI IN THE PROVINCE OF HARIMA WHICH IS I THINK ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL
8148-3956-0017 I CANNOT INDEED POINT OUT IN DETAIL ITS MOST REMARKABLE FEATURES
8148-3956-0018 HERE TOO THE HOME OF THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE CONSTITUTES AN OBJECT OF GREAT ATTRACTION
8148-3956-0019 HE IS THE DESCENDANT OF A HIGH PERSONAGE AND WAS NOT WITHOUT HOPE OF ELEVATION AT COURT BUT BEING OF AN ECCENTRIC CHARACTER HE WAS STRONGLY AVERSE TO SOCIETY HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A CHIUJIO OF THE IMPERIAL GUARD
8148-3956-0020 BUT HAVING RESIGNED THAT OFFICE HAD BECOME GOVERNOR OF HARIMA HE WAS NOT HOWEVER POPULAR IN THAT OFFICE IN THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS HE REFLECTED WITHIN HIMSELF NO DOUBT THAT HIS PRESENCE IN THE CAPITAL COULD NOT BUT BE DISAGREEABLE
8148-3956-0021 WHEN THEREFORE HIS TERM OF OFFICE EXPIRED HE DETERMINED STILL TO REMAIN IN THE PROVINCE HE DID NOT HOWEVER GO TO THE MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS OF THE INTERIOR BUT CHOSE THE SEA COAST THERE ARE IN THIS DISTRICT
8148-3956-0022 SEVERAL PLACES WHICH ARE WELL SITUATED FOR QUIET RETIREMENT AND IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED INCONSISTENT IN HIM HAD HE PREFERRED A PART OF THE SEA COAST SO NEAR THE GAY WORLD NEVERTHELESS A RETREAT IN THE TOO REMOTE INTERIOR WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SOLITARY
8148-3956-0023 AND MIGHT HAVE MET WITH OBJECTIONS ON THE PART OF HIS WIFE AND CHILD FOR THIS REASON IT APPEARS THAT HE FINALLY SELECTED THE PLACE WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO FOR THE SAKE OF HIS FAMILY
8148-3956-0024 WHEN I WENT DOWN THERE LAST TIME I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FAMILY AND I FOUND THAT THOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN WELL RECEIVED IN THE CAPITAL YET THAT HERE HAVING BEEN FORMERLY GOVERNOR
8148-3956-0025 HE ENJOYS CONSIDERABLE POPULARITY AND RESPECT HIS RESIDENCE MOREOVER IS WELL APPOINTED AND OF SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE AND HE PERFORMS WITH PUNCTUALITY AND DEVOUTNESS HIS RELIGIOUS DUTIES NAY ALMOST WITH MORE EARNESTNESS
8148-3956-0026 THAN MANY REGULAR PRIESTS HERE GENJI INTERRUPTED WHAT IS HIS DAUGHTER LIKE WITHOUT DOUBT ANSWERED HIS COMPANION THE BEAUTY OF HER PERSON IS UNRIVALLED AND SHE IS ENDOWED WITH CORRESPONDING MENTAL ABILITY
8148-3956-0027 SUCCESSIVE GOVERNORS OFTEN OFFER THEIR ADDRESSES TO HER WITH GREAT SINCERITY BUT NO ONE HAS EVER YET BEEN ACCEPTED THE DOMINANT IDEA OF HER FATHER SEEMS TO BE THIS WHAT HAVE I SUNK TO SUCH A POSITION WELL I TRUST AT LEAST
8148-3956-0028 THAT MY ONLY DAUGHTER MAY BE SUCCESSFUL AND PROSPEROUS IN HER LIFE HE OFTEN TOLD HER I HEARD THAT IF SHE SURVIVED HIM AND IF HIS FOND HOPES FOR HER SHOULD NOT BE REALIZED IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER TO CAST HERSELF INTO THE SEA
8148-3956-0029 GENJI WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN THIS CONVERSATION AND THE REST OF THE COMPANY LAUGHINGLY SAID AH SHE IS A WOMAN WHO IS LIKELY TO BECOME THE QUEEN OF THE BLUE MAIN IN VERY TRUTH HER FATHER MUST BE AN EXTRAORDINARY BEING
8148-3956-0030 THE ATTENDANT WHO HAD GIVEN THIS ACCOUNT OF THE EX GOVERNOR AND HIS DAUGHTER WAS THE SON OF THE PRESENT GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE HE WAS UNTIL LATELY A KURAND AND THIS YEAR HAD RECEIVED THE TITLE OF JUGOI HIS NAME WAS YOSHIKIYO
8148-3956-0031 AND HE TOO WAS A MAN OF GAY HABITS WHICH GAVE OCCASION TO ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS TO OBSERVE AH PERHAPS YOU ALSO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DISAPPOINT THE HOPES OF THE AGED FATHER ANOTHER SAID WELL OUR FRIEND HAS GIVEN US A LONG ACCOUNT
8148-3956-0032 BUT WE MUST TAKE IT WITH SOME RESERVE SHE MUST BE AFTER ALL A COUNTRY MAIDEN AND ALL THAT I CAN GIVE CREDIT TO IS THIS MUCH THAT HER MOTHER MAY BE A WOMAN OF SOME SENSE WHO TAKES GREAT CARE OF THE GIRL I AM ONLY AFRAID THAT IF ANY FUTURE GOVERNOR
8148-3956-0033 SHOULD BE SEIZED WITH AN ARDENT DESIRE TO POSSESS HER SHE WOULD NOT LONG REMAIN UNATTACHED WHAT POSSIBLE OBJECT COULD IT SERVE IF SHE WERE CARRIED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA THE NATIVES OF THE DEEP WOULD DERIVE NO PLEASURE FROM HER CHARMS
8148-3956-0034 REMARKED GENJI WHILE HE HIMSELF SECRETLY DESIRED TO BEHOLD HER AY THOUGHT HIS COMPANIONS WITH HIS SUSCEPTIBLE TEMPERAMENT WHAT WONDER IF THIS STORY TOUCHES HIM
8148-3956-0035 THE DAY WAS FAR ADVANCED AND THE PRINCE PREPARED TO LEAVE THE MOUNTAIN THE HERMIT HOWEVER TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SPEND THE EVENING IN THE TEMPLE AND TO BE FURTHER PRAYED FOR HIS ATTENDANTS ALSO SUPPORTED THIS SUGGESTION
8148-3956-0036 SO GENJI MADE UP HIS MIND TO STAY THERE SAYING THEN I SHALL NOT RETURN HOME TILL TO MORROW THE DAYS AT THIS SEASON WERE OF LONG DURATION AND HE FELT IT RATHER TIRESOME TO PASS A WHOLE EVENING IN SEDATE SOCIETY SO
8148-3956-0037 HE WENT OUT OF THE TEMPLE AND PROCEEDED TO THE PRETTY BUILDING ENCLOSED BY HEDGES ALL THE ATTENDANTS HAD BEEN DESPATCHED HOME EXCEPT KOREMITZ WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM THEY PEEPED AT THIS BUILDING THROUGH THE HEDGES
8148-3956-0038 IN THE WESTERN ANTECHAMBER OF THE HOUSE WAS PLACED AN IMAGE OF BUDDHA AND HERE AN EVENING SERVICE WAS PERFORMED A NUN RAISING A CURTAIN BEFORE BUDDHA OFFERED A GARLAND OF FLOWERS ON THE ALTAR AND PLACING A KIO OR SUTRA
8148-3956-0039 I E BUDDHIST BIBLE ON HER ARM STOOL PROCEEDED TO READ IT SHE SEEMED TO BE RATHER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OLD HER FACE WAS RATHER ROUND AND HER APPEARANCE WAS NOBLE HER HAIR WAS THROWN BACK FROM HER FOREHEAD
8148-3956-0040 AND WAS CUT SHORT BEHIND WHICH SUITED HER VERY WELL SHE WAS HOWEVER PALE AND WEAK HER VOICE ALSO BEING TREMULOUS TWO MAIDEN ATTENDANTS WENT IN AND OUT OF THE ROOM WAITING UPON HER
8148-3956-0041 SHE WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD OR MORE AND WORE A WHITE SILK DRESS WHICH FITTED HER WELL AND WHICH WAS LINED WITH YELLOW HER HAIR WAS WAVED LIKE A FAN AND HER EYES WERE RED FROM CRYING WHAT IS THE MATTER
8148-3956-0042 HAVE YOU QUARRELLED WITH THE BOY EXCLAIMED THE NUN LOOKING AT HER THERE WAS SOME RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE FEATURES OF THE CHILD AND THE NUN SO GENJI THOUGHT THAT SHE POSSIBLY MIGHT BE HER DAUGHTER INUKI HAS LOST MY SPARROW
8148-3956-0043 WHICH I KEPT SO CAREFULLY IN THE CAGE REPLIED THE CHILD THAT STUPID BOY SAID ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS HAS HE AGAIN BEEN THE CAUSE OF THIS WHERE CAN THE BIRD BE GONE AND ALL THIS TOO AFTER WE HAD TAMED IT WITH SO MUCH CARE
8148-3956-0044 SHE THEN LEFT THE ROOM POSSIBLY TO LOOK FOR THE LOST BIRD THE PEOPLE WHO ADDRESSED HER CALLED HER SHIONAGON AND SHE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN THE LITTLE GIRL'S NURSE TO YOU SAID THE NUN TO THE GIRL
8148-3956-0045 THE SPARROW MAY BE DEARER THAN I MAY BE WHO AM SO ILL BUT HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU OFTEN THAT THE CAGING OF BIRDS IS A SIN BE A GOOD GIRL COME NEARER
8148-3956-0046 THE CONTOUR OF THE CHILD LIKE FOREHEAD AND OF THE SMALL AND GRACEFUL HEAD WAS VERY PLEASING GENJI AS HE SURVEYED THE SCENE FROM WITHOUT THOUGHT WITHIN HIMSELF IF SHE IS THUS FAIR IN HER GIRLHOOD WHAT WILL SHE BE WHEN SHE IS GROWN UP
8148-3956-0047 ONE REASON WHY GENJI WAS SO MUCH ATTRACTED BY HER WAS THAT SHE GREATLY RESEMBLED A CERTAIN LADY IN THE PALACE TO WHOM HE FOR A LONG TIME HAD BEEN FONDLY ATTACHED THE NUN STROKED THE BEAUTIFUL HAIR OF THE CHILD AND MURMURED TO HERSELF
8148-3956-0048 HOW SPLENDID IT LOOKS WOULD THAT SHE WOULD ALWAYS STRIVE TO KEEP IT THUS HER EXTREME YOUTH MAKES ME ANXIOUS HOWEVER HER MOTHER DEPARTED THIS LIFE WHEN SHE ONLY A VERY YOUNG GIRL BUT SHE WAS QUITE SENSIBLE AT THE AGE OF THIS ONE
8148-3956-0049 SUPPOSING THAT I WERE TO LEAVE HER BEHIND I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HER AS SHE THUS MURMURED HER COUNTENANCE BECAME SADDENED BY HER FOREBODINGS THE SIGHT MOVED GENJI'S SYMPATHY AS HE GAZED
8148-3956-0050 FOR SHE SILENTLY WATCHED THE EXPRESSION OF THE NUN'S FEATURES AND THEN WITH DOWNCAST EYES BENT HER FACE TOWARDS THE GROUND THE LUSTROUS HAIR FALLING OVER HER BACK IN WAVES THE NUN HUMMED IN A TONE SUFFICIENTLY AUDIBLE TO GENJI
8148-3956-0051 THE DEWS THAT WET THE TENDER GRASS AT THE SUN'S BIRTH TOO QUICKLY PASS NOR E'ER CAN HOPE TO SEE IT RISE IN FULL PERFECTION TO THE SKIES SHIONAGON WHO NOW JOINED THEM AND HEARD THE ABOVE DISTICH
8148-3956-0052 CONSOLED THE NUN WITH THE FOLLOWING THE DEWS WILL NOT SO QUICKLY PASS NOR SHALL DEPART BEFORE THEY SEE THE FULL PERFECTION OF THE GRASS THEY LOVED SO WELL IN INFANCY AT THIS JUNCTURE A PRIEST ENTERED AND SAID
8148-3956-0053 DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS VERY DAY PRINCE GENJI VISITED THE HERMIT IN ORDER TO BE EXORCISED BY HIM I MUST FORTHWITH GO AND SEE HIM GENJI OBSERVING THIS MOVEMENT QUICKLY RETURNED TO THE MONASTERY THINKING AS HE WENT
8148-3956-0054 WHAT A LOVELY GIRL HE HAD SEEN I CAN GUESS FROM THIS THOUGHT HE WHY THOSE GAY FELLOWS REFERRING TO HIS ATTENDANTS SO OFTEN MAKE THEIR EXPEDITIONS IN SEARCH OF GOOD FORTUNE WHAT A CHARMING LITTLE GIRL HAVE I SEEN TO DAY WHO CAN SHE BE
8148-3956-0055 WOULD THAT I COULD SEE HER MORNING AND EVENING IN THE PALACE WHERE I CAN NO LONGER SEE THE FAIR LOVED ONE WHOM SHE RESEMBLES HE NOW RETURNED TO THE MONASTERY AND RETIRED TO HIS QUARTERS SOON AFTER A DISCIPLE OF THE PRIEST CAME
8148-3956-0056 SAYING MY MASTER HAS JUST HEARD OF THE PRINCE'S VISIT TO THE MOUNTAIN AND WOULD HAVE WAITED ON HIM AT ONCE BUT THOUGHT IT BETTER TO POSTPONE CALLING NEVERTHELESS
8148-3956-0057 AND FEELS DISAPPOINTED THAT HE HAS NOT YET HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO GENJI SAID IN REPLY
8148-3956-0058 AND THEREFORE BY THE ADVICE OF MY FRIENDS I CAME TO THIS MOUNTAIN TO BE EXORCISED IF HOWEVER THE SPELLS OF THE HOLY MAN ARE OF NO AVAIL TO ME HIS REPUTATION MIGHT SUFFER IN CONSEQUENCE
8148-3956-0059 FOR THAT REASON I WISH TO KEEP MY VISIT AS PRIVATE AS POSSIBLE NEVERTHELESS I WILL COME NOW TO YOUR MASTER THEREUPON THE PRIEST HIMSELF SOON MADE HIS APPEARANCE AND AFTER BRIEFLY RELATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES
8148-3956-0060 WHICH HAD OCCASIONED HIS RETIREMENT TO THIS LOCALITY HE OFFERED TO ESCORT GENJI TO HIS HOUSE SAYING MY DWELLING IS BUT A RUSTIC COTTAGE BUT STILL I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO SEE AT LEAST THE PRETTY MOUNTAIN STREAMLET WHICH WATERS MY GARDEN
8148-3956-0061 GENJI ACCEPTED THE OFFER THINKING AS HE WENT I WONDER WHAT THE PRIEST HAS SAID AT HOME ABOUT MYSELF TO THOSE TO WHOM I HAVE NOT YET BEEN INTRODUCED BUT IT WILL BE PLEASANT TO SEE THEM ONCE MORE THE NIGHT WAS MOONLESS
8148-3956-0062 THE FOUNTAIN WAS LIT UP BY TORCHES AND MANY LAMPS ALSO WERE LIGHTED IN THE GARDEN GENJI WAS TAKEN TO AN AIRY ROOM IN THE SOUTHERN FRONT OF THE BUILDING WHERE INCENSE WHICH WAS BURNING THREW ITS SWEET ODORS AROUND THE PRIEST RELATED TO HIM
8148-3956-0063 MANY INTERESTING ANECDOTES AND ALSO SPOKE ELOQUENTLY OF MAN'S FUTURE DESTINY GENJI AS HE HEARD HIM FELT SOME QUALMS OF CONSCIENCE FOR HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS OWN CONDUCT WAS FAR FROM BEING IRREPROACHABLE THE THOUGHT TROUBLED HIM
8148-3956-0064 THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE FREE FROM THE STING OF THESE RECOLLECTIONS THROUGH HIS LIFE AND THAT THERE WAS A WORLD TO COME TOO OH COULD I BUT LIVE IN A RETREAT LIKE THIS PRIEST AS HE THUS THOUGHT OF A RETREAT
8148-3956-0065 HE WAS INVOLUNTARILY TAKEN BY A FANCY THAT HOW HAPPY WOULD HE BE IF ACCOMPANIED TO SUCH A RETREAT BY SUCH A GIRL AS HE HAD SEEN IN THE EVENING AND WITH THIS FANCY HER LOVELY FACE ROSE UP BEFORE HIM SUDDENLY HE SAID TO THE PRIEST
8148-3956-0066 I HAD ONCE A DREAM WHICH MADE ME ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHO WAS LIVING IN THIS HOUSE AND HERE TO DAY THAT DREAM HAS AGAIN COME BACK TO MY MEMORY THE PRIEST LAUGHED AND SAID A STRANGE DREAM EVEN WERE YOU TO OBTAIN YOUR WISH
8148-3956-0067 IT MIGHT NOT GRATIFY YOU THE LATE LORD AZECHI DAINAGON DIED LONG AGO AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM WELL HIS WIDOW IS MY SISTER AND SINCE HER HUSBAND'S DEATH HER HEALTH HAS NOT BEEN SATISFACTORY
8148-3956-0068 SO LATELY SHE HAS BEEN LIVING HERE IN RETIREMENT AH YES SAID GENJI VENTURING UPON A GUESS AND I HEARD THAT SHE BORE A DAUGHTER TO DAINAGON YES SHE HAD A DAUGHTER BUT SHE DIED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
8148-3956-0069 I KNOW NOT HOW IT CAME TO PASS BUT SHE BECAME SECRETLY INTIMATE
8148-3956-0070 BUT THE PRINCE'S WIFE WAS VERY JEALOUS AND SEVERE SO SHE HAD MUCH TO SUFFER AND PUT UP WITH I SAW PERSONALLY THE TRUTH THAT CARE KILLS MORE THAN LABOR
8148-3956-0071 THE LITTLE ONE IS HER DAUGHTER AND NO WONDER THAT SHE RESEMBLES THE ONE IN THE PALACE
8148-3956-0072 HOW WOULD IT BE IF I HAD FREE CONTROL OVER HER AND HAD HER BROUGHT UP AND EDUCATED ACCORDING TO MY OWN NOTIONS SO THINKING HE PROCEEDED TO SAY HOW SAD IT WAS THAT SHE DIED DID SHE LEAVE ANY OFFSPRING SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD AT HER DEATH
8148-3956-0073 WHICH WAS ALSO A GIRL AND ABOUT THIS GIRL THE GRANDMOTHER IS ALWAYS FEELING VERY ANXIOUS THEN SAID GENJI LET IT NOT APPEAR STRANGE TO YOU IF I SAY THIS BUT I SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO BECOME THE GUARDIAN OF THIS GIRL
8148-3956-0074 WILL YOU SPEAK TO HER GRANDMOTHER ABOUT IT IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS ONE TO WHOM MY LOT IS LINKED BUT I CARE BUT LITTLE FOR HER AND INDEED USUALLY LEAD A SOLITARY LIFE YOUR OFFER IS VERY KIND REPLIED THE PRIEST
8148-3956-0075 BUT SHE IS EXTREMELY YOUNG HOWEVER EVERY WOMAN GROWS UP UNDER THE PROTECTING CARE OF SOME ONE AND SO I CANNOT SAY MUCH ABOUT HER ONLY IT SHALL BE MENTIONED TO MY SISTER
8148-3956-0076 THE PRIEST SAID THIS WITH A GRAVE AND EVEN A STERN EXPRESSION ON HIS COUNTENANCE WHICH CAUSED GENJI TO DROP THE SUBJECT HE THEN ASKED THE PRINCE TO EXCUSE HIM FOR IT WAS THE HOUR FOR VESPERS AND AS HE QUITTED THE ROOM TO ATTEND THE SERVICE
8148-3956-0077 SAID HE WOULD RETURN AS SOON AS IT WAS FINISHED GENJI WAS ALONE A SLIGHT SHOWER FELL OVER THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY AND THE MOUNTAIN BREEZES BLEW COOL THE WATERS OF THE TORRENT WERE SWOLLEN AND THE ROAR OF THEM
8148-3956-0078 MIGHT BE HEARD FROM AFAR BROKEN AND INDISTINCT ONE MIGHT HEAR THE MELANCHOLY SOUND OF THE SLEEPY INTONATION OF PRAYERS EVEN THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO SORROW OF THEIR OWN OFTEN FEEL MELANCHOLY FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY ARE PLACED
8148-3956-0079 SO GENJI WHOSE MIND WAS OCCUPIED IN THOUGHT COULD NOT SLUMBER HERE THE PRIEST SAID HE WAS GOING TO VESPERS BUT IN REALITY IT WAS LATER THAN THE PROPER TIME FOR THEM GENJI PERCEIVED
8148-3956-0080 THEY WERE VERY QUIET YET THE SOUND OF THE TELLING OF BEADS WHICH ACCIDENTALLY STRUCK THE LECTERN WAS HEARD FROM TIME TO TIME THE ROOM WAS NOT FAR FROM HIS OWN HE PULLED THE SCREEN SLIGHTLY ASIDE AND STANDING NEAR THE DOOR
8148-3956-0081 HE STRUCK HIS FAN ON HIS HAND TO SUMMON SOME ONE WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER SAID AN ATTENDANT AND AS SHE CAME NEAR TO THE PRINCE'S ROOM SHE ADDED PERHAPS MY EAR WAS DECEIVED AND SHE BEGAN TO RETIRE BUDDHA WILL GUIDE YOU
8148-3956-0082 FEAR NOT THE DARKNESS I AM HERE SAID GENJI SIR REPLIED THE SERVANT TIMIDLY PRAY DO NOT THINK ME PRESUMPTUOUS SAID GENJI BUT MAY I BEG YOU TO TRANSMIT THIS POETICAL EFFUSION TO YOUR MISTRESS FOR ME
8148-3956-0083 SINCE FIRST THAT TENDER GRASS I VIEWED MY HEART NO SOFT REPOSE E'ER FEELS BUT GATHERING MIST MY SLEEVE BEDEWS AND PITY TO MY BOSOM STEALS SURELY YOU SHOULD KNOW SIR
8148-3956-0084 THAT THERE IS NO ONE HERE TO WHOM SUCH THINGS CAN BE PRESENTED BELIEVE ME I HAVE MY OWN REASONS FOR THIS SAID GENJI LET ME BESEECH YOU TO TAKE IT SO THE ATTENDANT WENT BACK AND PRESENTED IT TO THE NUN
8148-3956-0085 I DO NOT SEE THE REAL INTENT OF THE EFFUSION THOUGHT THE NUN PERHAPS HE THINKS THAT SHE IS ALREADY A WOMAN BUT SHE CONTINUED WONDERINGLY HOW COULD HE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE YOUNG GRASS
8148-3956-0086 AND SHE THEN REMAINED SILENT FOR A WHILE AT LAST THINKING IT WOULD BE UNBECOMING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF IT SHE GAVE ORALLY THE FOLLOWING REPLY TO THE ATTENDANT TO BE GIVEN TO GENJI YOU SAY YOUR SLEEVE IS WET WITH DEW
8148-3956-0087 TIS BUT ONE NIGHT ALONE FOR YOU BUT THERE'S A MOUNTAIN MOSS GROWS NIGH WHOSE LEAVES FROM DEW ARE NEVER DRY WHEN GENJI HEARD THIS HE SAID
8148-3956-0088 THROUGH THE MOUTH OF A THIRD PERSON ALTHOUGH I THANK THE LADY FOR EVEN THAT MUCH I SHOULD FEEL MORE OBLIGED TO HER IF SHE WOULD GRANT ME AN INTERVIEW AND ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN TO HER MY SINCERE WISHES
8148-3956-0089 THIS AT LENGTH OBLIGED THE NUN TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PRINCE HE THEN TOLD HER THAT HE CALLED BUDDHA TO WITNESS THAT THOUGH HIS CONDUCT MAY HAVE SEEMED BOLD IT WAS DICTATED BY PURE AND CONSCIENTIOUS MOTIVES
8148-3956-0090 ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR FAMILY HISTORY ARE KNOWN TO ME CONTINUED HE LOOK UPON ME I PRAY AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR YOUR ONCE LOVED DAUGHTER I TOO WHEN A MERE INFANT
8148-3956-0091 WAS DEPRIVED BY DEATH OF MY BEST FRIEND MY MOTHER AND THE YEARS AND MONTHS WHICH THEN ROLLED BY WERE FRAUGHT WITH TROUBLE TO ME IN THAT SAME POSITION YOUR LITTLE ONE IS NOW ALLOW US THEN TO BECOME FRIENDS
8148-3956-0092 WE COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH EACH OTHER TWAS TO REVEAL THESE WISHES TO YOU THAT I CAME HERE AND RISKED THE CHANCE OF OFFENDING YOU IN DOING SO BELIEVE ME I AM WELL DISPOSED AT YOUR OFFER SAID THE NUN
8148-3956-0093 BUT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN INCORRECTLY INFORMED IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A LITTLE GIRL DEPENDENT UPON MYSELF BUT SHE IS BUT A CHILD HER SOCIETY COULD NOT AFFORD YOU ANY PLEASURE AND FORGIVE ME THEREFORE
8148-3956-0094 IF I DECLINE YOUR REQUEST YET LET THERE BE NO RESERVE IN THE EXPRESSION OF YOUR IDEAS INTERRUPTED GENJI BUT BEFORE THEY COULD TALK FURTHER THE RETURN OF THE PRIEST PUT AN END TO THE SUBJECT AND GENJI RETIRED TO HIS QUARTERS
8148-3956-0095 AFTER THANKING THE NUN FOR HIS KIND RECEPTION THE NIGHT PASSED AWAY AND DAWN APPEARED THE SKY WAS AGAIN HAZY AND HERE
8148-3956-0096 THE DEER TOO WHICH WERE TO BE SEEN HERE ADDED TO THE BEAUTY OF THE PICTURE GAZING AROUND AT THESE GENJI ONCE MORE PROCEEDED TO THE TEMPLE
