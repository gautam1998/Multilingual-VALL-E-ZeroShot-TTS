6135-41995-0000 LECOQ HAD TAKEN HIS SEAT IN FRONT BETWEEN THE DRIVER AND THE GUARD BUT HIS MIND WAS SO ENGROSSED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS THAT HE HEARD NOTHING OF THEIR CONVERSATION WHICH WAS VERY JOVIAL
6135-41995-0001 WHO SANG AND YELLED HER IMPRECATIONS ALTERNATELY IT IS NEEDLESS HOWEVER TO RECAPITULATE HER OATHS LET US RATHER FOLLOW THE TRAIN OF LECOQ'S MEDITATION BY WHAT MEANS COULD HE SECURE SOME CLUE TO THE MURDERER'S IDENTITY
6135-41995-0002 HE WAS STILL CONVINCED THAT THE PRISONER MUST BELONG
6135-41995-0003 SUCH CONDUCT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE INDEED ALMOST PROBABLE ON THE PART OF A MAN ENDOWED WITH CONSIDERABLE STRENGTH OF WILL AND REALIZING THE IMMINENCE OF HIS PERIL BUT GRANTING THIS WOULD HE BE EQUALLY ABLE TO HIDE HIS FEELINGS
6135-41995-0004 WHEN HE WAS OBLIGED TO SUBMIT TO THE HUMILIATING FORMALITIES THAT AWAITED HIM FORMALITIES WHICH IN CERTAIN CASES CAN AND MUST
6135-41995-0005 HE FELT SURE THAT THE DISGRACEFUL POSITION IN WHICH THE PRISONER WOULD FIND HIMSELF WOULD CAUSE HIM TO REVOLT TO LOSE HIS SELF CONTROL TO UTTER SOME WORD THAT MIGHT GIVE THE DESIRED CLUE IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE GLOOMY VEHICLE
6135-41995-0006 HAD TURNED OFF THE PONT NEUF ON TO THE QUAI DE L'HORLOGE THAT THE YOUNG DETECTIVE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF WHAT WAS TRANSPIRING AROUND HIM SOON THE VAN PASSED THROUGH AN OPEN GATEWAY AND DREW UP IN A SMALL DAMP COURTYARD
6135-41995-0007 LECOQ IMMEDIATELY ALIGHTED AND OPENED THE DOOR OF THE COMPARTMENT IN WHICH THE SUPPOSED MURDERER WAS CONFINED EXCLAIMING AS HE DID SO HERE WE ARE GET OUT THERE WAS NO FEAR OF THE PRISONER ESCAPING THE IRON GATE HAD BEEN CLOSED
6135-41995-0008 AND AT LEAST A DOZEN AGENTS WERE STANDING NEAR AT HAND WAITING TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEW ARRIVALS THE PRISONER SLOWLY STEPPED TO THE GROUND HIS EXPRESSION OF FACE REMAINED UNCHANGED AND EACH GESTURE EVINCED THE PERFECT INDIFFERENCE
6135-41995-0009 OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH ORDEALS LECOQ SCRUTINIZED HIS DEMEANOR AS ATTENTIVELY AS AN ANATOMIST MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ACTION OF A MUSCLE HE NOTED THAT THE PRISONER SEEMED TO EXPERIENCE A SENSATION OF SATISFACTION
6135-41995-0010 AND THEN STRETCHED AND SHOOK HIMSELF AS IF TO REGAIN THE ELASTICITY OF HIS LIMBS CRAMPED BY CONFINEMENT IN THE NARROW COMPARTMENT FROM WHICH HE HAD JUST EMERGED THEN HE GLANCED AROUND HIM AND A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SMILE PLAYED UPON HIS LIPS
6135-41995-0011 THAT HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THESE HIGH GRIM WALLS THESE GRATED WINDOWS THESE HEAVY DOORS IN SHORT
6135-41995-0012 DOES HE INDEED RECOGNIZE THE PLACE AND HIS SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND DISQUIETUDE INCREASED
6135-41995-0013 THE PRISONER TURNED TOWARD ONE OF THE FIVE OR SIX DOORS THAT OPENED INTO THE COURTYARD WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S HESITATION HE WALKED STRAIGHT TOWARD THE VERY DOORWAY HE WAS EXPECTED TO ENTER
6135-41995-0014 AFTER ENTERING THE GLOOMY CORRIDOR HE SAW THE CULPRIT PROCEED SOME LITTLE DISTANCE RESOLUTELY TURN TO THE LEFT PASS BY THE KEEPER'S ROOM AND FINALLY ENTER THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE AN OLD OFFENDER COULD NOT HAVE DONE BETTER
6135-41995-0015 BIG DROPS OF PERSPIRATION STOOD ON LECOQ'S FOREHEAD THIS MAN THOUGHT HE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN HERE BEFORE HE KNOWS THE ROPES THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE WAS A LARGE ROOM
6135-41995-0016 HEATED ALMOST TO SUFFOCATION BY AN IMMENSE STOVE AND BADLY LIGHTED BY THREE SMALL WINDOWS THE PANES OF WHICH WERE COVERED WITH A THICK COATING OF DUST THERE SAT THE CLERK READING A NEWSPAPER SPREAD OUT OVER THE OPEN REGISTER
6135-41995-0017 THAT FATAL BOOK IN WHICH ARE INSCRIBED THE NAMES OF ALL THOSE WHOM MISCONDUCT CRIME MISFORTUNE MADNESS OR ERROR HAVE BROUGHT TO THESE GRIM PORTALS THREE OR FOUR ATTENDANTS
6135-41995-0018 WHO WERE AWAITING THE HOUR FOR ENTERING UPON THEIR DUTIES RECLINED HALF ASLEEP UPON THE WOODEN BENCHES THAT LINED THREE SIDES OF THE ROOM THESE BENCHES WITH A COUPLE OF TABLES AND SOME DILAPIDATED CHAIRS CONSTITUTED THE ENTIRE FURNITURE OF THE OFFICE
6135-41995-0019 IN ONE CORNER OF WHICH STOOD A MEASURING MACHINE UNDER WHICH
6135-41995-0020 THE EXACT HEIGHT OF THE PRISONERS BEING RECORDED IN ORDER THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THEIR PERSONS MIGHT BE COMPLETE IN EVERY RESPECT AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CULPRIT ACCOMPANIED BY LECOQ THE CLERK RAISED HIS HEAD AH SAID HE HAS THE VAN ARRIVED
6135-41995-0021 AND SHOWING THE ORDERS SIGNED BY M D'ESCORVAL HE ADDED HERE ARE THIS MAN'S PAPERS THE REGISTRAR TOOK THE DOCUMENTS AND READ THEM OH HE EXCLAIMED A TRIPLE ASSASSINATION OH OH
6135-41995-0022 THE GLANCE HE GAVE THE PRISONER WAS POSITIVELY DEFERENTIAL THIS WAS NO COMMON CULPRIT NO ORDINARY VAGABOND NO VULGAR THIEF THE INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATE ORDERS A PRIVATE EXAMINATION CONTINUED THE CLERK
6135-41995-0023 AND I MUST GET THE PRISONER OTHER CLOTHING AS THE THINGS HE IS WEARING NOW WILL BE USED AS EVIDENCE LET SOME ONE GO AT ONCE AND TELL THE SUPERINTENDENT THAT THE OTHER OCCUPANTS OF THE VAN MUST WAIT AT THIS MOMENT THE GOVERNOR OF THE DEPOT ENTERED THE OFFICE
6135-41995-0024 THE CLERK AT ONCE DIPPED HIS PEN IN THE INK AND TURNING TO THE PRISONER HE ASKED WHAT IS YOUR NAME MAY YOUR CHRISTIAN NAME I HAVE NONE
6135-41995-0025 AND THEN ANSWERED SULKILY I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU THAT YOU NEED NOT TIRE YOURSELF BY QUESTIONING ME I SHAN'T ANSWER ANY ONE ELSE BUT THE MAGISTRATE YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ME CUT MY OWN THROAT WOULDN'T YOU A VERY CLEVER TRICK OF COURSE
6135-41995-0026 YOU MUST SEE
6135-41995-0027 OBSERVED THE GOVERNOR NOT IN THE LEAST I AM INNOCENT YOU WISH TO RUIN ME I ONLY DEFEND MYSELF GET ANYTHING MORE OUT OF ME NOW IF YOU CAN BUT YOU HAD BETTER GIVE ME BACK WHAT THEY TOOK FROM ME AT THE STATION HOUSE
6135-41995-0028 MY HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX FRANCS AND EIGHT SOUS I SHALL NEED THEM WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS PLACE I WANT YOU TO MAKE A NOTE OF THEM ON THE REGISTER WHERE ARE THEY THE MONEY HAD BEEN GIVEN TO LECOQ BY THE KEEPER OF THE STATION HOUSE
6135-41995-0029 HERE ARE YOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX FRANCS AND EIGHT SOUS SAID HE AND ALSO YOUR KNIFE YOUR HANDKERCHIEF AND FOUR CIGARS AN EXPRESSION OF LIVELY CONTENTMENT WAS DISCERNIBLE ON THE PRISONER'S FEATURES
6135-41995-0030 NOW RESUMED THE CLERK WILL YOU ANSWER BUT THE GOVERNOR PERCEIVED THE FUTILITY OF FURTHER QUESTIONING AND SILENCING THE CLERK BY A GESTURE HE TOLD THE PRISONER TO TAKE OFF HIS BOOTS LECOQ THOUGHT THE ASSASSIN'S GLANCE WAVERED AS HE HEARD THIS ORDER
6135-41995-0031 WAS IT ONLY A FANCY WHY MUST I DO THAT ASKED THE CULPRIT TO PASS UNDER THE BEAM REPLIED THE CLERK WE MUST MAKE A NOTE OF YOUR EXACT HEIGHT THE PRISONER MADE NO REPLY
6135-41995-0032 BUT SAT DOWN AND DREW OFF HIS HEAVY BOOTS THE HEEL OF THE RIGHT ONE WAS WORN DOWN ON THE INSIDE IT WAS MOREOVER NOTICED THAT THE PRISONER WORE NO SOCKS AND THAT HIS FEET WERE COATED WITH MUD
6135-41995-0033 YOU ONLY WEAR BOOTS ON SUNDAYS THEN REMARKED LECOQ WHY DO YOU THINK THAT BY THE MUD WITH WHICH YOUR FEET ARE COVERED
6135-41995-0034 WHAT OF THAT EXCLAIMED THE PRISONER IN AN INSOLENT TONE IS IT A CRIME NOT TO HAVE A MARCHIONESS'S FEET IT IS A CRIME YOU ARE NOT GUILTY OF AT ALL EVENTS SAID THE YOUNG DETECTIVE SLOWLY DO YOU THINK I CAN'T SEE
6135-41995-0035 THAT IF THE MUD WERE PICKED OFF YOUR FEET WOULD BE WHITE AND NEAT THE NAILS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY CUT AND POLISHED HE PAUSED A NEW IDEA INSPIRED BY HIS GENIUS FOR INVESTIGATION HAD JUST CROSSED LECOQ'S MIND
6135-41995-0036 AND SPREADING A NEWSPAPER OVER IT HE SAID WILL YOU PLACE YOUR FOOT THERE THE MAN DID NOT COMPLY WITH THE REQUEST IT IS USELESS TO RESIST EXCLAIMED THE GOVERNOR WE ARE IN FORCE THE PRISONER DELAYED NO LONGER
6135-41995-0037 ANYWHERE ELSE SO STRANGE AND GROTESQUE A PROCEEDING WOULD HAVE EXCITED LAUGHTER BUT HERE IN THIS GLOOMY CHAMBER
6135-41995-0038 AN OTHERWISE TRIVIAL ACT IS FRAUGHT WITH SERIOUS IMPORT NOTHING ASTONISHES AND SHOULD A SMILE THREATEN TO CURVE ONE'S LIPS IT IS INSTANTLY REPRESSED ALL THE SPECTATORS FROM THE GOVERNOR OF THE PRISON TO THE KEEPERS
6135-41995-0039 HAD WITNESSED MANY OTHER INCIDENTS EQUALLY ABSURD AND NO ONE THOUGHT OF INQUIRING THE DETECTIVE'S MOTIVE THIS MUCH WAS KNOWN ALREADY THAT THE PRISONER WAS TRYING TO CONCEAL HIS IDENTITY NOW IT WAS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH IT AT ANY COST
6135-41995-0040 AND LECOQ HAD PROBABLY DISCOVERED SOME MEANS OF ATTAINING THIS END THE OPERATION WAS SOON CONCLUDED AND LECOQ SWEPT THE DUST OFF THE PAPER INTO THE PALM OF HIS HAND HE DIVIDED IT INTO TWO PARTS ENCLOSING ONE PORTION IN A SCRAP OF PAPER
6135-41995-0041 AND SLIPPING IT INTO HIS OWN POCKET WITH THE REMAINDER HE FORMED A PACKAGE WHICH HE HANDED TO THE GOVERNOR SAYING I BEG YOU SIR TO TAKE CHARGE OF THIS AND TO SEAL IT UP HERE IN PRESENCE OF THE PRISONER THIS FORMALITY IS NECESSARY
6135-41995-0042 SO THAT BY AND BY HE MAY NOT PRETEND THAT THE DUST HAS BEEN CHANGED THE GOVERNOR COMPLIED WITH THE REQUEST AND AS HE PLACED THIS BIT OF PROOF AS HE STYLED IT IN A SMALL SATCHEL FOR SAFE KEEPING THE PRISONER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WITH A SNEERING LAUGH
6135-41995-0043 STILL BENEATH THIS CYNICAL GAIETY LECOQ THOUGHT HE COULD DETECT POIGNANT ANXIETY CHANCE OWED HIM THE COMPENSATION OF THIS SLIGHT TRIUMPH FOR PREVIOUS EVENTS HAD DECEIVED ALL HIS CALCULATIONS
6135-41995-0044 THE PRISONER DID NOT OFFER THE SLIGHTEST OBJECTION WHEN HE WAS ORDERED TO UNDRESS AND TO EXCHANGE HIS SOILED AND BLOODSTAINED GARMENTS FOR THE CLOTHING FURNISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT A MUSCLE OF HIS FACE MOVED WHILE HE SUBMITTED HIS PERSON
6135-41995-0045 WHICH MAKE THE BLOOD RUSH TO THE FOREHEAD OF THE LOWEST CRIMINAL IT WAS WITH PERFECT INDIFFERENCE THAT HE ALLOWED AN INSPECTOR TO COMB HIS HAIR AND BEARD AND TO EXAMINE THE INSIDE OF HIS MOUTH SO AS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE HAD NOT CONCEALED
6135-41995-0046 EITHER SOME FRAGMENT OF GLASS BY THE AID OF WHICH CAPTIVES CAN SEVER THE STRONGEST BARS OR ONE OF THOSE MICROSCOPICAL BITS OF LEAD WITH WHICH PRISONERS WRITE THE NOTES THEY EXCHANGE ROLLED UP IN A MORSEL OF BREAD AND CALLED
6135-41995-0047 POSTILIONS THESE FORMALITIES HAVING BEEN CONCLUDED THE SUPERINTENDENT RANG FOR ONE OF THE KEEPERS CONDUCT THIS MAN TO NO THREE OF THE SECRET CELLS HE ORDERED THERE WAS NO NEED TO DRAG THE PRISONER AWAY HE WALKED OUT AS HE HAD ENTERED
6135-41995-0048 PRECEDING THE GUARD LIKE SOME OLD HABITUE WHO KNOWS WHERE HE IS GOING WHAT A RASCAL EXCLAIMED THE CLERK
6135-41995-0049 AH THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF IT DECLARED THE GOVERNOR THIS MAN IS CERTAINLY A DANGEROUS CRIMINAL AN OLD OFFENDER I THINK I HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE I COULD ALMOST SWEAR TO IT THUS IT WAS EVIDENT THESE PEOPLE WITH THEIR LONG VARIED EXPERIENCE
6135-41995-0050 SHARED GEVROL'S OPINION LECOQ STOOD ALONE HE DID NOT DISCUSS THE MATTER WHAT GOOD WOULD IT HAVE DONE BESIDES THE WIDOW CHUPIN WAS JUST BEING BROUGHT IN THE JOURNEY MUST HAVE CALMED HER NERVES FOR SHE HAD BECOME AS GENTLE AS A LAMB
6135-41995-0051 IT WAS IN A WHEEDLING VOICE AND WITH TEARFUL EYES THAT SHE CALLED UPON THESE GOOD GENTLEMEN TO WITNESS THE SHAMEFUL INJUSTICE WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED SHE AN HONEST WOMAN WAS SHE NOT THE MAINSTAY OF HER FAMILY
6135-41995-0052 SINCE HER SON POLYTE WAS IN CUSTODY CHARGED WITH POCKET PICKING HENCE WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HER DAUGHTER IN LAW AND OF HER GRANDSON TOTO WHO HAD NO ONE TO LOOK AFTER THEM BUT HER STILL WHEN HER NAME HAD BEEN TAKEN AND A KEEPER WAS ORDERED TO REMOVE HER
6135-41995-0053 NATURE REASSERTED ITSELF AND SCARCELY HAD SHE ENTERED THE CORRIDOR THAN SHE WAS HEARD QUARRELING WITH THE GUARD YOU ARE WRONG NOT TO BE POLITE SHE SAID YOU ARE LOSING A GOOD FEE WITHOUT COUNTING MANY A GOOD DRINK I WOULD STAND YOU WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE
6135-41995-0054 HE WANDERED THROUGH THE GLOOMY CORRIDORS FROM OFFICE TO OFFICE BUT FINDING HIMSELF ASSAILED WITH QUESTIONS BY EVERY ONE HE CAME ACROSS HE EVENTUALLY LEFT THE DEPOT
6135-41995-0055 HERE HE TRIED TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS HIS CONVICTIONS WERE UNCHANGED HE WAS MORE THAN EVER CONVINCED THAT THE PRISONER WAS CONCEALING HIS REAL SOCIAL STANDING BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
6135-41995-0056 HE HAD ALSO PROVED HIMSELF TO BE ENDOWED WITH FAR MORE CLEVERNESS THAN LECOQ HAD SUPPOSED WHAT SELF CONTROL WHAT POWERS OF DISSIMULATION HE HAD DISPLAYED HE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS FROWNED WHILE UNDERGOING THE SEVEREST ORDEALS
6135-41995-0057 AND HE HAD MANAGED TO DECEIVE THE MOST EXPERIENCED EYES IN PARIS THE YOUNG DETECTIVE HAD WAITED DURING NEARLY THREE HOURS AS MOTIONLESS AS THE BENCH ON WHICH HE WAS SEATED AND SO ABSORBED IN STUDYING HIS CASE THAT HE HAD THOUGHT NEITHER OF THE COLD
6135-41995-0058 NOR OF THE FLIGHT OF TIME WHEN A CARRIAGE DREW UP BEFORE THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRISON
6135-41995-0059 FOLLOWED BY HIS CLERK LECOQ ROSE AND HASTENED WELL NIGH BREATHLESS WITH ANXIETY TOWARD THE MAGISTRATE MY RESEARCHES ON THE SPOT SAID THIS FUNCTIONARY CONFIRM ME IN THE BELIEF THAT YOU ARE RIGHT IS THERE ANYTHING FRESH YES SIR
6135-41995-0060 INTERRUPTED THE MAGISTRATE YOU WILL EXPLAIN IT TO ME BY AND BY FIRST OF ALL I MUST SUMMARILY EXAMINE THE PRISONERS A MERE MATTER OF FORM FOR TO DAY WAIT FOR ME HERE ALTHOUGH THE MAGISTRATE PROMISED TO MAKE HASTE
6135-41995-0061 IN THIS HE WAS MISTAKEN TWENTY MINUTES LATER
6135-41995-0062 HE WAS WALKING VERY FAST AND INSTEAD OF APPROACHING THE YOUNG DETECTIVE HE CALLED TO HIM AT SOME LITTLE DISTANCE I MUST RETURN HOME AT ONCE HE SAID INSTANTLY I CAN NOT LISTEN TO YOU BUT SIR ENOUGH
6135-41995-0063 THE BODIES OF THE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE MORGUE KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT THERE THEN THIS EVENING MAKE WELL DO WHATEVER YOU THINK BEST BUT SIR I MUST TO MORROW TO MORROW AT NINE O'CLOCK IN MY OFFICE IN THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE
6135-41995-0064 LECOQ WISHED TO INSIST UPON A HEARING
6135-41995-0065 THROWN HIMSELF INTO HIS CARRIAGE AND THE COACHMAN WAS ALREADY WHIPPING UP THE HORSE AND TO THINK THAT HE'S AN INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATE PANTED LECOQ
6135-41995-0066 CAN IT BE HE MURMURED
6135-41995-0067 HOLDS THE KEY TO THE MYSTERY PERHAPS HE WISHES TO GET RID OF ME THIS SUSPICION WAS SO TERRIBLE
6135-41995-0068 HOPING THAT THE PRISONER'S BEARING MIGHT HELP TO SOLVE HIS DOUBTS ON PEERING THROUGH THE GRATED APERTURE IN THE DOOR OF THE CELL HE PERCEIVED THE PRISONER LYING ON THE PALLET THAT STOOD OPPOSITE THE DOOR HIS FACE WAS TURNED TOWARD THE WALL
6135-41995-0069 FOR LECOQ COULD DETECT A STRANGE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY WHICH PUZZLED AND ANNOYED HIM ON APPLYING HIS EAR INSTEAD OF HIS EYE TO THE APERTURE HE DISTINGUISHED A STIFLED MOAN THERE COULD NO LONGER BE ANY DOUBT
6135-41995-0070 THE DEATH RATTLE WAS SOUNDING IN THE PRISONER'S THROAT
6135-41995-0071 THE PRISONER IS KILLING HIMSELF A DOZEN KEEPERS HASTENED TO THE SPOT THE DOOR WAS QUICKLY OPENED AND IT WAS THEN ASCERTAINED THAT THE PRISONER HAVING TORN A STRIP OF BINDING FROM HIS CLOTHES HAD FASTENED IT ROUND HIS NECK AND TRIED TO STRANGLE HIMSELF
6135-41995-0072 HE WAS ALREADY UNCONSCIOUS AND THE PRISON DOCTOR WHO IMMEDIATELY BLED HIM DECLARED THAT HAD ANOTHER TEN MINUTES ELAPSED HELP WOULD HAVE ARRIVED TOO LATE WHEN THE PRISONER REGAINED HIS SENSES HE GAZED AROUND HIM WITH A WILD PUZZLED STARE
6135-41995-0073 ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS AMAZED TO FIND HIMSELF STILL ALIVE SUDDENLY A COUPLE OF BIG TEARS WELLED FROM HIS SWOLLEN EYELIDS AND ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS HE WAS PRESSED WITH QUESTIONS
6135-41995-0074 BUT DID NOT VOUCHSAFE SO MUCH AS A SINGLE WORD IN RESPONSE AS HE WAS IN SUCH A DESPERATE FRAME OF MIND AND AS THE ORDERS TO KEEP HIM IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT PREVENTED THE GOVERNOR GIVING HIM A COMPANION
6135-41995-0075 AND THEN WALKED AWAY PUZZLED THOUGHTFUL AND AGITATED INTUITION TOLD HIM THAT THESE MYSTERIOUS OCCURRENCES CONCEALED SOME TERRIBLE DRAMA STILL WHAT CAN HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE PRISONER'S ARRIVAL HERE HE MURMURED
6135-41995-0076 HAS HE CONFESSED HIS GUILT TO THE MAGISTRATE OR
