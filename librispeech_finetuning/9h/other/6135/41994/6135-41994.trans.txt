6135-41994-0014 HE SUCCEEDED IN FINDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE MURDERER HE PLAYED HIS PART PERFECTLY STILL I KNOW THAT HE DID PLAY A PART AND THAT IS SOMETHING
6135-41994-0015 HE TALKED OF HIS FAMILY HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN HENCE HE HAS NEITHER CHILDREN WIFE NOR FAMILY
6135-41994-0016 WHAT KIND OF FELLOW WAS THIS DRUNKARD HE INQUIRED HE WAS TALL AND STOUT WITH FULL RUDDY CHEEKS A PAIR OF WHITE WHISKERS SMALL EYES A BROAD FLAT NOSE AND A GOOD NATURED JOVIAL MANNER
6135-41994-0017 HOW OLD WOULD YOU SUPPOSE HIM TO BE BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY DID YOU FORM ANY IDEA OF HIS PROFESSION IT'S MY OPINION THAT WHAT WITH HIS SOFT CAP AND HIS HEAVY BROWN OVERCOAT HE MUST BE EITHER A CLERK
6135-41994-0018 OR THE KEEPER OF SOME LITTLE SHOP HAVING OBTAINED THIS DESCRIPTION
6135-41994-0019 LECOQ WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE STATION HOUSE WHEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT BROUGHT HIM TO A STANDSTILL
6135-41994-0020 HE EXCLAIMED THE KEEPER LAUGHED HEARTILY HOW COULD HE HAVE HAD ANY HE RESPONDED ISN'T THE OLD WOMAN ALONE IN HER CELL AH THE OLD WRETCH SHE HAS BEEN CURSING AND THREATENING EVER SINCE SHE ARRIVED
6135-41994-0021 LECOQ'S GLANCE AND GESTURE WERE SO EXPRESSIVE OF IMPATIENCE AND WRATH THAT THE KEEPER PAUSED IN HIS RECITAL MUCH PERTURBED WHAT IS THE MATTER HE STAMMERED WHY ARE YOU ANGRY BECAUSE REPLIED LECOQ FURIOUSLY
6135-41994-0022 NOT WISHING TO DISCLOSE THE REAL CAUSE OF HIS ANGER HE ENTERED THE STATION HOUSE SAYING THAT HE WANTED TO SEE THE PRISONER LEFT ALONE THE KEEPER BEGAN TO SWEAR IN HIS TURN THESE POLICE AGENTS ARE ALL ALIKE HE GRUMBLED THEY QUESTION YOU
6135-41994-0023 YOU TELL THEM ALL THEY DESIRE TO KNOW AND AFTERWARD IF YOU VENTURE TO ASK THEM ANYTHING THEY REPLY NOTHING OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOO MUCH AUTHORITY IT MAKES THEM PROUD LOOKING THROUGH THE LITTLE LATTICED WINDOW IN THE DOOR
6135-41994-0024 BY WHICH THE MEN ON GUARD WATCH THE PRISONERS LECOQ EAGERLY EXAMINED THE APPEARANCE OF THE ASSUMED MURDERER HE WAS OBLIGED TO ASK HIMSELF IF THIS WAS REALLY THE SAME MAN HE HAD SEEN SOME HOURS PREVIOUSLY AT THE POIVRIERE
6135-41994-0025 STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE INNER DOOR AND HOLDING THE WHOLE SQUAD OF POLICE AGENTS IN CHECK BY THE INTENSE FURY OF HIS ATTITUDE NOW ON THE CONTRARY HE SEEMED AS IT WERE THE PERSONIFICATION OF WEAKNESS AND DESPONDENCY
6135-41994-0026 HE WAS SEATED ON A BENCH OPPOSITE THE GRATING IN THE DOOR HIS ELBOWS RESTING ON HIS KNEES HIS CHIN UPON HIS HAND
6135-41994-0027 NO MURMURED LECOQ NO THIS MAN IS NOT WHAT HE SEEMS TO BE SO SAYING HE ENTERED THE CELL THE CULPRIT RAISED HIS HEAD GAVE THE DETECTIVE AN INDIFFERENT GLANCE BUT DID NOT UTTER A WORD WELL HOW GOES IT
6135-41994-0028 ASKED LECOQ I AM INNOCENT RESPONDED THE PRISONER IN A HOARSE DISCORDANT VOICE I HOPE SO I AM SURE BUT THAT IS FOR THE MAGISTRATE TO DECIDE I CAME TO SEE IF YOU WANTED ANYTHING NO REPLIED THE MURDERER
6135-41994-0029 BUT A SECOND LATER HE CHANGED HIS MIND ALL THE SAME HE SAID I SHOULDN'T MIND A CRUST AND A DRINK OF WINE
6135-41994-0030 IN HIS OPINION IF THE MURDERER HAD ASKED FOR A DRINK AFTER AT FIRST REFUSING TO PARTAKE OF ANYTHING
6135-41994-0031 AT ALL EVENTS WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE THE PRISONER ATE WITH AN EXCELLENT APPETITE
6135-41994-0032 DRAINED IT SLOWLY AND REMARKED THAT'S CAPITAL THERE CAN BE NOTHING TO BEAT THAT
6135-41994-0033 HOPING NAY ALMOST EXPECTING THAT THE MURDERER WOULD NOT DRINK IT WITHOUT SOME SIGN OF REPUGNANCE AND YET THE CONTRARY PROVED THE CASE HOWEVER THE YOUNG DETECTIVE HAD NO TIME TO PONDER OVER THE CIRCUMSTANCE
6135-41994-0034 FOR A RUMBLE OF WHEELS NOW ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF THAT LUGUBRIOUS VEHICLE THE BLACK MARIA WHEN THE WIDOW CHUPIN WAS REMOVED FROM HER CELL
6135-41994-0035 THAT SHE WAS AT LENGTH GOT INTO THE VAN THEN IT WAS THAT THE OFFICIALS TURNED TO THE ASSASSIN
6135-41994-0036 THE CULPRIT ENTERED THE VEHICLE IN THE MOST UNCONCERNED MANNER AND TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS COMPARTMENT LIKE ONE ACCUSTOMED TO IT KNOWING THE MOST COMFORTABLE POSITION TO ASSUME IN SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS
