1746-143015-0012 THE ASSEMBLAGE NUMBERED ABOUT A HUNDRED MEN ONE OR TWO OF THESE WERE ACTUAL FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE SOME WERE CRIMINAL AND ALL WERE RECKLESS PHYSICALLY THEY EXHIBITED NO INDICATION OF THEIR PAST LIVES AND CHARACTER
1746-143015-0013 THE GREATEST SCAMP HAD A RAPHAEL FACE WITH A PROFUSION OF BLONDE HAIR OAKHURST A GAMBLER HAD THE MELANCHOLY AIR AND INTELLECTUAL ABSTRACTION OF A HAMLET THE COOLEST AND MOST COURAGEOUS MAN
1746-143015-0014 THE TERM ROUGHS APPLIED TO THEM WAS A DISTINCTION RATHER THAN A DEFINITION
1746-143015-0015 THE CAMP MAY HAVE BEEN DEFICIENT BUT THESE SLIGHT OMISSIONS DID NOT DETRACT FROM THEIR AGGREGATE FORCE THE STRONGEST MAN HAD BUT THREE FINGERS ON HIS RIGHT HAND THE BEST SHOT HAD BUT ONE EYE
1746-143015-0016 SUCH WAS THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE MEN THAT WERE DISPERSED AROUND THE CABIN
1746-143015-0017 THE ONLY OUTLET WAS A STEEP TRAIL OVER THE SUMMIT OF A HILL THAT FACED THE CABIN NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE RISING MOON THE SUFFERING WOMAN MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT FROM THE RUDE BUNK WHEREON SHE LAY
1746-143015-0018 SEEN IT WINDING LIKE A SILVER THREAD UNTIL IT WAS LOST IN THE STARS ABOVE A FIRE OF WITHERED PINE BOUGHS ADDED SOCIABILITY TO THE GATHERING
1746-143015-0019 BETS WERE FREELY OFFERED AND TAKEN REGARDING THE RESULT THREE TO FIVE THAT SAL WOULD GET THROUGH WITH IT EVEN THAT THE CHILD WOULD SURVIVE SIDE BETS AS TO THE SEX AND COMPLEXION OF THE COMING STRANGER
1746-143015-0020 THOSE NEAREST THE DOOR AND THE CAMP STOPPED TO LISTEN ABOVE THE SWAYING AND MOANING OF THE PINES THE SWIFT RUSH OF THE RIVER AND THE CRACKLING OF THE FIRE
1746-143015-0021 THE PINES STOPPED MOANING
1746-143015-0022 IT SEEMED AS IF NATURE HAD STOPPED TO LISTEN TOO THE CAMP ROSE TO ITS FEET AS ONE MAN IT WAS PROPOSED TO EXPLODE A BARREL OF GUNPOWDER
1746-143015-0023 BUT IN CONSIDERATION OF THE SITUATION OF THE MOTHER BETTER COUNSELS PREVAILED
1746-143015-0024 FOR WHETHER OWING TO THE RUDE SURGERY OF THE CAMP OR SOME OTHER REASON CHEROKEE SAL WAS SINKING FAST WITHIN AN HOUR SHE HAD CLIMBED AS IT WERE THAT RUGGED ROAD THAT LED TO THE STARS
1746-143015-0025 AND SO PASSED OUT OF ROARING CAMP ITS SIN AND SHAME FOREVER I DO NOT THINK THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT DISTURBED THEM MUCH EXCEPT IN SPECULATION AS TO THE FATE OF THE CHILD CAN HE LIVE NOW WAS ASKED OF STUMPY
1746-143015-0026 THE ANSWER WAS DOUBTFUL THE ONLY OTHER BEING OF CHEROKEE SAL'S SEX AND MATERNAL CONDITION IN THE SETTLEMENT WAS AN ASS THERE WAS SOME CONJECTURE AS TO FITNESS BUT THE EXPERIMENT WAS TRIED IT WAS LESS PROBLEMATICAL
1746-143015-0027 THAN THE ANCIENT TREATMENT OF ROMULUS AND REMUS AND APPARENTLY AS SUCCESSFUL WHEN THESE DETAILS WERE COMPLETED WHICH EXHAUSTED ANOTHER HOUR THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND THE ANXIOUS CROWD OF MEN
1746-143015-0028 BESIDE THE LOW BUNK OR SHELF ON WHICH THE FIGURE OF THE MOTHER WAS STARKLY OUTLINED BELOW THE BLANKETS STOOD A PINE TABLE ON THIS A CANDLE BOX WAS PLACED AND WITHIN IT
1746-143015-0029 LAY THE LAST ARRIVAL AT ROARING CAMP BESIDE THE CANDLE BOX WAS PLACED A HAT ITS USE WAS SOON INDICATED GENTLEMEN SAID STUMPY WITH A SINGULAR MIXTURE OF AUTHORITY AND EX OFFICIO COMPLACENCY
1746-143015-0030 GENTLEMEN WILL PLEASE PASS IN AT THE FRONT DOOR ROUND THE TABLE AND OUT AT THE BACK DOOR THEM AS WISHES TO CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING TOWARD THE ORPHAN WILL FIND A HAT HANDY THE FIRST MAN ENTERED WITH HIS HAT ON
1746-143015-0031 HE UNCOVERED HOWEVER AS HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM
1746-143015-0032 GOOD AND BAD ACTIONS ARE CATCHING AS THE PROCESSION FILED IN COMMENTS WERE AUDIBLE CRITICISMS ADDRESSED PERHAPS RATHER TO STUMPY IN THE CHARACTER OF SHOWMAN IS THAT HIM MIGHTY SMALL SPECIMEN
1746-143015-0033 AIN'T BIGGER NOR A DERRINGER
1746-143015-0034 A SILVER TOBACCO BOX A DOUBLOON A NAVY REVOLVER SILVER MOUNTED A GOLD SPECIMEN A VERY BEAUTIFULLY EMBROIDERED LADY'S HANDKERCHIEF FROM OAKHURST THE GAMBLER
1746-143015-0035 A DIAMOND BREASTPIN A DIAMOND RING
1746-143015-0036 HE SAW THAT PIN AND WENT TWO DIAMONDS BETTER A SLUNG SHOT A BIBLE CONTRIBUTOR NOT DETECTED A GOLDEN SPUR A SILVER TEASPOON THE INITIALS I REGRET TO SAY WERE NOT THE GIVER'S A PAIR OF SURGEON'S SHEARS
1746-143015-0037 A LANCET A BANK OF ENGLAND NOTE FOR FIVE POUNDS AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN LOOSE GOLD AND SILVER COIN
1746-143015-0038 A GRAVITY AS INSCRUTABLE AS THAT OF THE NEWLY BORN ON HIS RIGHT ONLY ONE INCIDENT OCCURRED TO BREAK THE MONOTONY OF THE CURIOUS PROCESSION AS KENTUCK BENT OVER THE CANDLE BOX
1746-143015-0039 HALF CURIOUSLY THE CHILD TURNED AND IN A SPASM OF PAIN CAUGHT AT HIS GROPING FINGER AND HELD IT FAST FOR A MOMENT KENTUCK LOOKED FOOLISH AND EMBARRASSED
1746-143015-0040 THE DAMNED LITTLE CUSS HE SAID AS HE EXTRICATED HIS FINGER WITH PERHAPS MORE TENDERNESS AND CARE THAN HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEEMED CAPABLE OF SHOWING HE HELD THAT FINGER A LITTLE APART FROM ITS FELLOWS AS HE WENT OUT
1746-143015-0041 IN FACT HE SEEMED TO ENJOY REPEATING IT
1746-143015-0042 THE DAMNED LITTLE CUSS IT WAS FOUR O'CLOCK BEFORE THE CAMP SOUGHT REPOSE A LIGHT BURNT IN THE CABIN WHERE THE WATCHERS SAT FOR STUMPY DID NOT GO TO BED THAT NIGHT NOR DID KENTUCK
1746-143015-0043 HE DRANK QUITE FREELY AND RELATED WITH GREAT GUSTO HIS EXPERIENCE INVARIABLY ENDING WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC CONDEMNATION OF THE NEWCOMER
1746-143015-0044 AND KENTUCK HAD THE WEAKNESSES OF THE NOBLER SEX WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE HAD GONE TO BED
1746-143015-0045 THEN HE WALKED UP THE GULCH PAST THE CABIN STILL WHISTLING WITH DEMONSTRATIVE UNCONCERN
1746-143015-0046 AND AGAIN PASSED THE CABIN HALFWAY DOWN TO THE RIVER'S BANK HE AGAIN PAUSED AND THEN RETURNED AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR IT WAS OPENED BY STUMPY HOW GOES IT SAID KENTUCK LOOKING PAST STUMPY TOWARD THE CANDLE BOX
1746-143015-0047 ALL SERENE REPLIED STUMPY ANYTHING UP NOTHING THERE WAS A PAUSE AN EMBARRASSING ONE STUMPY STILL HOLDING THE DOOR THEN KENTUCK HAD RECOURSE TO HIS FINGER WHICH HE HELD UP TO STUMPY
1746-143015-0048 RASTLED WITH IT THE
1746-143015-0049 HE SAID AND RETIRED THE NEXT DAY CHEROKEE SAL HAD SUCH RUDE SEPULTURE AS ROARING CAMP AFFORDED
1746-143015-0050 BUT THE UNLUCKY SUGGESTION MET WITH FIERCE AND UNANIMOUS OPPOSITION IT WAS EVIDENT THAT NO PLAN WHICH ENTAILED PARTING FROM THEIR NEW ACQUISITION WOULD FOR A MOMENT BE ENTERTAINED BESIDES SAID TOM RYDER
1746-143015-0051 THEM FELLOWS AT RED DOG WOULD SWAP IT AND RING IN SOMEBODY ELSE ON US A DISBELIEF IN THE HONESTY OF OTHER CAMPS PREVAILED AT ROARING CAMP AS IN OTHER PLACES
1746-143015-0052 ALSO MET WITH OBJECTION IT WAS ARGUED THAT NO DECENT WOMAN COULD BE PREVAILED TO ACCEPT ROARING CAMP AS HER HOME AND THE SPEAKER URGED THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ANY MORE OF THE OTHER KIND THIS UNKIND ALLUSION TO THE DEFUNCT MOTHER
1746-143015-0053 WAS THE FIRST SPASM OF PROPRIETY THE FIRST SYMPTOM OF THE CAMP'S REGENERATION STUMPY ADVANCED NOTHING PERHAPS HE FELT A CERTAIN DELICACY IN INTERFERING WITH THE SELECTION OF A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR IN OFFICE
1746-143015-0054 BUT WHEN QUESTIONED HE AVERRED STOUTLY THAT HE AND JINNY THE MAMMAL BEFORE ALLUDED TO COULD MANAGE TO REAR THE CHILD THERE WAS SOMETHING ORIGINAL INDEPENDENT AND HEROIC ABOUT THE PLAN THAT PLEASED THE CAMP
1746-143015-0055 STUMPY WAS RETAINED CERTAIN ARTICLES WERE SENT FOR TO SACRAMENTO MIND SAID THE TREASURER AS HE PRESSED A BAG OF GOLD DUST INTO THE EXPRESSMAN'S HAND THE BEST THAT CAN BE GOT LACE YOU KNOW AND FILIGREE WORK AND FRILLS
1746-143015-0056 DAMN THE COST STRANGE TO SAY THE CHILD THRIVED PERHAPS THE INVIGORATING CLIMATE OF THE MOUNTAIN CAMP WAS COMPENSATION FOR MATERIAL DEFICIENCIES NATURE TOOK THE FOUNDLING TO HER BROADER BREAST
1746-143015-0057 IN THAT RARE ATMOSPHERE OF THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS THAT AIR PUNGENT WITH BALSAMIC ODOR THAT ETHEREAL CORDIAL AT ONCE BRACING AND EXHILARATING HE MAY HAVE FOUND FOOD AND NOURISHMENT
1746-143015-0058 ME AND THAT ASS HE WOULD SAY HAS BEEN FATHER AND MOTHER TO HIM DON'T YOU HE WOULD ADD APOSTROPHIZING THE HELPLESS BUNDLE BEFORE HIM NEVER GO BACK ON US
1746-143015-0059 BY THE TIME HE WAS A MONTH OLD THE NECESSITY OF GIVING HIM A NAME BECAME APPARENT HE HAD GENERALLY BEEN KNOWN AS THE KID STUMPY'S BOY THE COYOTE
1746-143015-0060 AN ALLUSION TO HIS VOCAL POWERS AND EVEN BY KENTUCK'S ENDEARING DIMINUTIVE OF THE DAMNED LITTLE CUSS BUT THESE WERE FELT TO BE VAGUE AND UNSATISFACTORY AND WERE AT LAST DISMISSED UNDER ANOTHER INFLUENCE
1746-143015-0061 GAMBLERS AND ADVENTURERS ARE GENERALLY SUPERSTITIOUS AND OAKHURST ONE DAY DECLARED THAT THE BABY HAD BROUGHT THE LUCK TO ROARING CAMP IT WAS CERTAIN THAT OF LATE THEY HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL LUCK
1746-143015-0062 NO ALLUSION WAS MADE TO THE MOTHER AND THE FATHER WAS UNKNOWN IT'S BETTER SAID THE PHILOSOPHICAL OAKHURST TO TAKE A FRESH DEAL ALL ROUND
1746-143015-0063 CALL HIM LUCK AND START HIM FAIR A DAY WAS ACCORDINGLY SET APART FOR THE CHRISTENING WHAT WAS MEANT BY THIS CEREMONY THE READER MAY IMAGINE WHO HAS ALREADY GATHERED SOME IDEA
1746-143015-0064 OF THE RECKLESS IRREVERENCE OF ROARING CAMP THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES WAS ONE BOSTON A NOTED WAG AND THE OCCASION SEEMED TO PROMISE THE GREATEST FACETIOUSNESS THIS INGENIOUS SATIRIST
1746-143015-0065 HAD SPENT TWO DAYS IN PREPARING A BURLESQUE OF THE CHURCH SERVICE WITH POINTED LOCAL ALLUSIONS THE CHOIR WAS PROPERLY TRAINED AND SANDY TIPTON WAS TO STAND GODFATHER
1746-143015-0066 BUT AFTER THE PROCESSION HAD MARCHED TO THE GROVE WITH MUSIC AND BANNERS AND THE CHILD HAD BEEN DEPOSITED BEFORE A MOCK ALTAR STUMPY STEPPED BEFORE THE EXPECTANT CROWD
1746-143015-0067 EYEING THE FACES AROUND HIM BUT IT STRIKES ME THAT THIS THING AIN'T EXACTLY ON THE SQUAR IT'S PLAYING IT PRETTY LOW DOWN ON THIS YER BABY TO RING IN FUN ON HIM THAT HE AIN'T GOIN TO UNDERSTAND
1746-143015-0068 AND EF THERE'S GOIN TO BE ANY GODFATHERS ROUND I'D LIKE TO SEE WHO'S GOT ANY BETTER RIGHTS THAN ME A SILENCE FOLLOWED STUMPY'S SPEECH
1746-143015-0069 BUT SAID STUMPY QUICKLY FOLLOWING UP HIS ADVANTAGE WE'RE HERE FOR A CHRISTENING AND WE'LL HAVE IT I PROCLAIM YOU THOMAS LUCK ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
1746-143015-0070 SO HELP ME GOD IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE NAME OF THE DEITY HAD BEEN OTHERWISE UTTERED THAN PROFANELY IN THE CAMP THE FORM OF CHRISTENING WAS PERHAPS EVEN MORE LUDICROUS THAN THE SATIRIST HAD CONCEIVED
1746-143015-0071 BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH NOBODY SAW IT AND NOBODY LAUGHED TOMMY WAS CHRISTENED AS SERIOUSLY AS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER A CHRISTIAN ROOF AND CRIED AND WAS COMFORTED
1746-143015-0072 ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY A CHANGE CAME OVER THE SETTLEMENT THE CABIN ASSIGNED TO TOMMY LUCK OR THE LUCK AS HE WAS MORE FREQUENTLY CALLED FIRST SHOWED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT
1746-143015-0073 IT WAS KEPT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN AND WHITEWASHED THEN IT WAS BOARDED CLOTHED AND PAPERED THE ROSE WOOD CRADLE PACKED EIGHTY MILES BY MULE HAD IN STUMPY'S WAY OF PUTTING IT SORTER KILLED THE REST OF THE FURNITURE
1746-143015-0074 SO THE REHABILITATION OF THE CABIN BECAME A NECESSITY THE MEN WHO WERE IN THE HABIT OF LOUNGING IN AT STUMPY'S TO SEE HOW THE LUCK GOT ON SEEMED TO APPRECIATE THE CHANGE
1746-143015-0075 AGAIN STUMPY IMPOSED A KIND OF QUARANTINE UPON THOSE WHO ASPIRED TO THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF HOLDING THE LUCK IT WAS A CRUEL MORTIFICATION TO KENTUCK
1746-143015-0076 WHICH LIKE A SNAKE'S ONLY SLOUGHED OFF THROUGH DECAY TO BE DEBARRED THIS PRIVILEGE FROM CERTAIN PRUDENTIAL REASONS YET SUCH WAS THE SUBTLE INFLUENCE OF INNOVATION THAT HE THEREAFTER APPEARED REGULARLY EVERY AFTERNOON IN A CLEAN SHIRT AND FACE
1746-143015-0077 NOR WERE MORAL AND SOCIAL SANITARY LAWS NEGLECTED TOMMY
1746-143015-0078 MUST NOT BE DISTURBED BY NOISE
1746-143015-0079 THE MEN CONVERSED IN WHISPERS OR SMOKED WITH INDIAN GRAVITY PROFANITY WAS TACITLY GIVEN UP IN THESE SACRED PRECINCTS AND THROUGHOUT THE CAMP A POPULAR FORM OF EXPLETIVE KNOWN AS
1746-143015-0080 AND CURSE THE LUCK WAS ABANDONED AS HAVING A NEW PERSONAL BEARING VOCAL MUSIC WAS NOT INTERDICTED BEING SUPPOSED TO HAVE A SOOTHING TRANQUILIZING QUALITY AND ONE SONG
1746-143015-0081 SUNG BY MAN O' WAR JACK AN ENGLISH SAILOR FROM HER MAJESTY'S AUSTRALIAN COLONIES WAS QUITE POPULAR AS A LULLABY IT WAS A LUGUBRIOUS RECITAL OF THE EXPLOITS OF THE ARETHUSA SEVENTY FOUR
1746-143015-0082 SMOKING THEIR PIPES AND DRINKING IN THE MELODIOUS UTTERANCES AN INDISTINCT IDEA THAT THIS WAS PASTORAL HAPPINESS PERVADED THE CAMP THIS ERE KIND O THINK
1746-143015-0083 SAID THE COCKNEY SIMMONS MEDITATIVELY RECLINING ON HIS ELBOW IS EVINGLY IT REMINDED HIM OF GREENWICH ON THE LONG SUMMER DAYS
1746-143015-0084 THE LUCK WAS USUALLY CARRIED TO THE GULCH FROM WHENCE THE GOLDEN STORE OF ROARING CAMP WAS TAKEN THERE ON A BLANKET SPREAD OVER PINE BOUGHS HE WOULD LIE WHILE THE MEN WERE WORKING IN THE DITCHES BELOW
1746-143015-0085 THE MEN HAD SUDDENLY AWAKENED TO THE FACT THAT THERE WERE BEAUTY AND SIGNIFICANCE IN THESE TRIFLES
1746-143015-0086 FRAGMENT OF VARIEGATED QUARTZ A BRIGHT PEBBLE FROM THE BED OF THE CREEK BECAME BEAUTIFUL TO EYES THUS CLEARED AND STRENGTHENED
1746-143015-0087 IT WAS WONDERFUL HOW MANY TREASURES THE WOODS AND HILLSIDES YIELDED THAT WOULD DO FOR TOMMY SURROUNDED BY PLAYTHINGS SUCH AS NEVER CHILD OUT OF FAIRYLAND HAD BEFORE IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT TOMMY WAS CONTENT
1746-143015-0088 HE APPEARED TO BE SERENELY HAPPY ALBEIT THERE WAS AN INFANTINE GRAVITY ABOUT HIM
1746-143015-0089 THAT SOMETIMES WORRIED STUMPY HE WAS ALWAYS TRACTABLE AND QUIET AND IT IS RECORDED THAT ONCE HAVING CREPT BEYOND HIS CORRAL A HEDGE OF TESSELLATED PINE BOUGHS WHICH SURROUNDED HIS BED
1746-143015-0090 HE DROPPED OVER THE BANK ON HIS HEAD IN THE SOFT EARTH
1746-143015-0091 I HESITATE TO RECORD THE MANY OTHER INSTANCES OF HIS SAGACITY WHICH REST UNFORTUNATELY UPON THE STATEMENTS OF PREJUDICED FRIENDS
1746-143015-0092 I CREP UP THE BANK JUST NOW SAID KENTUCK ONE DAY IN A BREATHLESS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
1746-143015-0093 TO HIM THE BIRDS SANG THE SQUIRRELS CHATTERED AND THE FLOWERS BLOOMED NATURE WAS HIS NURSE AND PLAYFELLOW FOR HIM SHE WOULD LET SLIP BETWEEN THE LEAVES GOLDEN SHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT THAT FELL JUST WITHIN HIS GRASP
1746-143015-0094 SHE WOULD SEND WANDERING BREEZES TO VISIT HIM WITH THE BALM OF BAY AND RESINOUS GUM
1746-143015-0095 THE BUMBLEBEES BUZZED AND THE ROOKS CAWED A SLUMBROUS ACCOMPANIMENT SUCH WAS THE GOLDEN SUMMER OF ROARING CAMP THEY WERE FLUSH TIMES AND THE LUCK WAS WITH THEM
1746-143015-0096 THE CLAIMS HAD YIELDED ENORMOUSLY THE CAMP WAS JEALOUS OF ITS PRIVILEGES AND LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY ON STRANGERS NO ENCOURAGEMENT WAS GIVEN TO IMMIGRATION
1746-143015-0097 THE LAND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN WALL THAT SURROUNDED THE CAMP THEY DULY PREEMPTED THIS
1746-143015-0098 KEPT THE RESERVE OF ROARING CAMP INVIOLATE THE EXPRESSMAN THEIR ONLY CONNECTING LINK WITH THE SURROUNDING WORLD SOMETIMES TOLD WONDERFUL STORIES OF THE CAMP HE WOULD SAY THEY'VE A STREET UP THERE IN ROARING
1746-143015-0099 THAT WOULD LAY OVER ANY STREET IN RED DOG THEY'VE GOT VINES AND FLOWERS ROUND THEIR HOUSES AND THEY WASH THEMSELVES TWICE A DAY BUT THEY'RE MIGHTY ROUGH ON STRANGERS
1746-143015-0100 AND TO INVITE ONE OR TWO DECENT FAMILIES TO RESIDE THERE FOR THE SAKE OF THE LUCK
1746-143015-0101 TO ITS GENERAL VIRTUE AND USEFULNESS CAN ONLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THEIR AFFECTION FOR TOMMY A FEW STILL HELD OUT BUT THE RESOLVE COULD NOT BE CARRIED INTO EFFECT FOR THREE MONTHS
1746-143015-0102 AND THE MINORITY MEEKLY YIELDED IN THE HOPE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT TURN UP TO PREVENT IT AND IT DID THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE WILL LONG BE REMEMBERED IN THE FOOTHILLS THE SNOW LAY DEEP ON THE SIERRAS
1746-143015-0103 EACH GORGE AND GULCH
1746-143015-0104 THAT DESCENDED THE HILLSIDES
1746-143015-0105 RED DOG HAD BEEN TWICE UNDER WATER AND ROARING CAMP HAD BEEN FOREWARNED
1746-143015-0106 IT BEEN HERE ONCE AND WILL BE HERE AGAIN AND THAT NIGHT THE NORTH FORK SUDDENLY LEAPED OVER ITS BANKS AND SWEPT UP THE TRIANGULAR VALLEY OF ROARING CAMP
1746-143015-0107 BUT LITTLE COULD BE DONE TO COLLECT THE SCATTERED CAMP WHEN THE MORNING BROKE THE CABIN OF STUMPY NEAREST THE RIVER BANK WAS GONE HIGHER UP THE GULCH THEY FOUND THE BODY OF ITS UNLUCKY OWNER BUT THE PRIDE THE HOPE THE JOY
1746-143015-0108 THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP HAD DISAPPEARED THEY WERE RETURNING WITH SAD HEARTS WHEN A SHOUT FROM THE BANK RECALLED THEM IT WAS A RELIEF BOAT FROM DOWN THE RIVER THEY HAD PICKED UP THEY SAID A MAN AND AN INFANT
1746-143015-0109 NEARLY EXHAUSTED ABOUT TWO MILES BELOW
1746-143015-0110 AND DID THEY BELONG HERE IT NEEDED BUT A GLANCE TO SHOW THEM KENTUCK LYING THERE CRUELLY CRUSHED AND BRUISED BUT STILL HOLDING THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP IN HIS ARMS
1746-143015-0111 AS THEY BENT OVER THE STRANGELY ASSORTED PAIR THEY SAW THAT THE CHILD WAS COLD AND PULSELESS HE IS DEAD SAID ONE KENTUCK OPENED HIS EYES DEAD HE REPEATED FEEBLY YES MY MAN
1746-143015-0112 AND YOU ARE DYING TOO A SMILE LIT THE EYES OF THE EXPIRING KENTUCK DYING HE REPEATED HE'S A TAKING ME WITH HIM TELL THE BOYS I'VE GOT THE LUCK WITH ME NOW AND THE STRONG MAN
