8765-295009-0000 THE PRISONERS WERE FREE AND THEIR JOY FOUND VENT IN THE NOISIEST DEMONSTRATIONS THEY EMPLOYED THE REST OF THE DAY IN REPAIRING THE HOUSE WHICH HAD SUFFERED GREATLY BY THE EXPLOSION THEY CLEARED AWAY THE BLOCKS PILED UP BY THE ANIMALS
8765-295009-0001 AND FILLED UP THE RENTS IN THE WALLS WORKING WITH MIGHT AND MAIN ENLIVENED BY THE MANY SONGS OF OLD JOHNSON NEXT MORNING THERE WAS A SINGULAR RISE IN THE TEMPERATURE
8765-295009-0002 AND SYMPTOMS OF A THAW APPEARED THE ICE BEGAN TO CRACK HERE AND THERE AND JETS OF SALT WATER WERE THROWN UP LIKE FOUNTAINS IN AN ENGLISH PARK
8765-295009-0003 A FEW DAYS LATER THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS THICK VAPOUR ROSE FROM THE SNOW GIVING PROMISE OF THE SPEEDY DISAPPEARANCE OF THESE IMMENSE MASSES THE SUN'S PALE DISC BECAME DEEPER IN COLOUR AND REMAINED LONGER ABOVE THE HORIZON
8765-295009-0004 THE BIRDS WERE RETURNING IN FLOCKS AND THE AIR RESOUNDED WITH THEIR DEAFENING CRIES
8765-295009-0005 THAT ALMOST ALL THESE ANIMALS WERE BEGINNING TO LOSE THEIR WHITE WINTER DRESS AND WOULD SOON PUT ON SUMMER ATTIRE WHILE NATURE WAS ALREADY PROVIDING MOSSES AND POPPIES
8765-295009-0006 BUT WITH THESE INOFFENSIVE ANIMALS CAME BACK THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES FOXES AND WOLVES ARRIVED IN SEARCH OF THEIR PREY AND DISMAL HOWLS BROKE THE SILENCE OF THE SHORT NIGHT ARCTIC WOLVES CLOSELY RESEMBLE DOGS
8765-295009-0007 AND THEIR BARKING WOULD DECEIVE THE MOST PRACTISED EARS EVEN THE CANINE RACE THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY IT INDEED IT SEEMS AS IF THE WILY ANIMALS EMPLOYED THIS RUSE TO ATTRACT THE DOGS AND MAKE THEM THEIR PREY
8765-295009-0008 SEVERAL NAVIGATORS HAVE MENTIONED THE FACT AND THE DOCTOR'S OWN EXPERIENCE CONFIRMED IT JOHNSON TOOK CARE NOT TO LET HIS GREENLANDERS LOOSE OF DUK THERE WAS LITTLE FEAR NOTHING COULD TAKE HIM IN FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT
8765-295009-0009 HUNTING WAS THE PRINCIPAL OCCUPATION THERE WAS AN ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF FRESH MEAT TO BE HAD THEY SHOT PARTRIDGES PTARMIGANS AND SNOW ORTOLANS WHICH ARE DELICIOUS EATING THE HUNTERS NEVER WENT FAR FROM FORT PROVIDENCE
8765-295009-0010 FOR GAME WAS SO PLENTIFUL THAT IT SEEMED WAITING THEIR GUNS AND THE WHOLE BAY PRESENTED AN ANIMATED APPEARANCE THE THAW MEANWHILE WAS MAKING RAPID PROGRESS
8765-295009-0011 AND THE WATER RAN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDES IN CATARACTS AND DASHED IN TORRENTS THROUGH THE RAVINES THE DOCTOR LOST NO TIME IN CLEARING ABOUT AN ACRE OF GROUND IN WHICH HE SOWED THE SEEDS OF ANTI SCORBUTIC PLANTS
8765-295009-0012 WHEN THE COLD RETURNED IN FULL FORCE
8765-295009-0013 EVERYTHING WAS FROZEN BIRDS QUADRUPEDS AMPHIBIA DISAPPEARED AS IF BY MAGIC SEAL HOLES RECLOSED AND THE ICE ONCE MORE BECAME HARD AS GRANITE THE CHANGE WAS MOST STRIKING
8765-295009-0014 IT OCCURRED ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF MAY DURING THE NIGHT THE DOCTOR WAS RATHER DISAPPOINTED AT HAVING ALL HIS WORK TO DO AGAIN BUT HATTERAS BORE THE GRIEVANCE MOST UNPHILOSOPHICALLY
8765-295009-0015 NO MY FRIEND I DON'T IT IS A LAST BLOW FROM THE COLD YOU SEE THESE ARE HIS DOMINIONS AND HE WON'T BE DRIVEN OUT WITHOUT MAKING SOME RESISTANCE HE CAN DEFEND HIMSELF PRETTY WELL SAID BELL RUBBING HIS FACE YES BUT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED
8765-295009-0016 AND NOT HAVE WASTED MY SEED LIKE AN IGNORAMUS
8765-295009-0017 BUT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY ASKED ALTAMONT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF COURSE AND WITHOUT BEING A WIZARD
8765-295009-0018 AND THE OTHER TWO SAINTS WHOSE FETE DAYS FALL THIS MONTH ABSURD PRAY TELL ME WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH IT WHAT INFLUENCE CAN THEY POSSIBLY HAVE ON THE TEMPERATURE
8765-295009-0019 AN IMMENSE ONE IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE HORTICULTURISTS WHO CALL THEM THE PATRON SAINTS OF THE FROST AND FOR WHAT REASON BECAUSE GENERALLY THERE IS A PERIODICAL FROST IN THE MONTH OF MAY AND IT IS COLDEST FROM THE ELEVENTH TO THE THIRTEENTH
8765-295009-0020 THAT IS THE FACT AND HOW IS IT EXPLAINED IN TWO WAYS SOME SAY THAT A LARGER NUMBER OF ASTEROIDS COME BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE SUN AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
8765-295009-0021 AND OTHERS THAT THE MERE MELTING OF THE SNOW NECESSARILY ABSORBS A LARGE AMOUNT OF HEAT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE LOW TEMPERATURE BOTH THEORIES ARE PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH BUT THE FACT REMAINS WHICHEVER WE ACCEPT
8765-295009-0022 THE DOCTOR WAS RIGHT FOR THE COLD LASTED TILL THE END OF THE MONTH AND PUT AN END TO ALL THEIR HUNTING EXPEDITIONS
8765-295009-0023 THIS WAS VIOLENT QUINSY BUT UNDER THE DOCTOR'S SKILFUL TREATMENT IT WAS SOON CURED ICE WAS THE ONLY REMEDY HE EMPLOYED ADMINISTERED IN SMALL PIECES
8765-295009-0024 CLAWBONNY DETERMINED TO HAVE A TALK WITH THE CAPTAIN ON AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT THE BUILDING OF A SLOOP OUT OF THE PLANKS OF THE PORPOISE THE DOCTOR HARDLY KNEW HOW TO BEGIN AS HATTERAS HAD DECLARED SO VEHEMENTLY THAT HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO USE A MORSEL OF AMERICAN WOOD
8765-295009-0025 YET IT WAS HIGH TIME HE WERE BROUGHT TO REASON AS JUNE WAS AT HAND THE ONLY SEASON FOR DISTANT EXPEDITIONS AND THEY COULD NOT START WITHOUT A SHIP HE THOUGHT OVER IT A LONG WHILE AND AT LAST DREW THE CAPTAIN ASIDE AND SAID IN THE KINDEST GENTLEST WAY
8765-295009-0026 MOST CERTAINLY I DO REPLIED THE CAPTAIN EARNESTLY MY BEST INDEED MY ONLY FRIEND AND IF I GIVE YOU A PIECE OF ADVICE WITHOUT YOUR ASKING WILL YOU CONSIDER MY MOTIVE IS PERFECTLY DISINTERESTED
8765-295009-0027 YES FOR I KNOW YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN ACTUATED BY SELF INTEREST BUT WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
8765-295009-0028 DO YOU LOOK ON ME AS A TRUE HEARTED ENGLISHMAN LIKE YOURSELF ANXIOUS FOR HIS COUNTRY'S GLORY HATTERAS LOOKED SURPRISED BUT SIMPLY SAID I DO
8765-295009-0029 AND I UNDERSTAND AND SHARE YOUR AMBITION BUT TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECT YOU MUST EMPLOY THE RIGHT MEANS WELL AND HAVE I NOT SACRIFICED EVERYTHING FOR IT NO HATTERAS YOU HAVE NOT SACRIFICED YOUR PERSONAL ANTIPATHIES
8765-295009-0030 AH IT IS THE BOAT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND THAT MAN HATTERAS LET US DISCUSS THE QUESTION CALMLY AND EXAMINE THE CASE ON ALL SIDES THE COAST ON WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES AT PRESENT MAY TERMINATE ABRUPTLY
8765-295009-0031 WE HAVE NO PROOF THAT IT STRETCHES RIGHT AWAY TO THE POLE INDEED IF YOUR PRESENT INFORMATION PROVE CORRECT WE OUGHT TO COME TO AN OPEN SEA DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WELL SUPPOSING WE REACH THIS ARCTIC OCEAN AND FIND IT FREE FROM ICE AND EASY TO NAVIGATE
8765-295009-0032 WHAT SHALL WE DO IF WE HAVE NO SHIP HATTERAS MADE NO REPLY TELL ME NOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO FIND YOURSELF ONLY A FEW MILES FROM THE POLE AND NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO IT HATTERAS STILL SAID NOTHING BUT BURIED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS
8765-295009-0033 BESIDES CONTINUED THE DOCTOR LOOK AT THE QUESTION IN ITS MORAL ASPECT HERE IS AN ENGLISHMAN WHO SACRIFICES HIS FORTUNE AND EVEN HIS LIFE TO WIN FRESH GLORY FOR HIS COUNTRY
8765-295009-0034 BUT BECAUSE THE BOAT WHICH BEARS HIM ACROSS AN UNKNOWN OCEAN OR TOUCHES THE NEW SHORE HAPPENS TO BE MADE OF THE PLANKS OF AN AMERICAN VESSEL A CAST AWAY WRECK OF NO USE TO ANYONE WILL THAT LESSEN THE HONOUR OF THE DISCOVERY
8765-295009-0035 AND MUST NOT A SLOOP BUILT BY FOUR ENGLISHMEN AND MANNED BY FOUR ENGLISHMEN BE ENGLISH FROM KEEL TO GUNWALE HATTERAS WAS STILL SILENT NO CONTINUED CLAWBONNY THE REAL TRUTH IS IT IS NOT THE SLOOP YOU CARE ABOUT IT IS THE MAN
8765-295009-0036 I HATE HIM WITH A THOROUGH ENGLISH HATRED FATE HAS THROWN HIM IN MY PATH TO SAVE YOU TO RUIN ME HE SEEMS TO DEFY ME AND SPEAKS AS IF HE WERE LORD AND MASTER
8765-295009-0037 HE THINKS HE HAS MY DESTINY IN HIS HANDS AND KNOWS ALL MY PROJECTS DIDN'T WE SEE THE MAN IN HIS TRUE COLOURS WHEN WE WERE GIVING NAMES TO THE DIFFERENT COASTS HAS HE EVER AVOWED HIS OBJECT IN COMING SO FAR NORTH
8765-295009-0038 WELL HATTERAS SUPPOSE IT IS SO DOES IT FOLLOW THAT THIS EXPEDITION IS TO SEARCH FOR THE NORTH POLE MAY IT NOT BE TO FIND THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE BUT ANYWAY
8765-295009-0039 ALTAMONT IS IN COMPLETE IGNORANCE OF OUR OBJECT FOR NEITHER JOHNSON NOR BELL NOR MYSELF HAVE EVER BREATHED A WORD TO HIM ABOUT IT AND I AM SURE YOU HAVE NOT WELL LET HIM ALWAYS REMAIN SO HE MUST BE TOLD IN THE END FOR WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM HERE ALONE WHY NOT
8765-295009-0040 CAN'T HE STAY HERE IN FORT PROVIDENCE HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO THAT HATTERAS AND MOREOVER TO LEAVE A MAN IN THAT WAY AND NOT KNOW WHETHER WE MIGHT FIND HIM SAFE WHEN WE CAME BACK WOULD BE WORSE THAN IMPRUDENT IT WOULD BE INHUMAN ALTAMONT WILL COME WITH US
8765-295009-0041 HE MUST COME BUT WE NEED NOT DISCLOSE OUR PROJECTS LET US TELL HIM NOTHING BUT SIMPLY BUILD A SLOOP FOR THE OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE OF MAKING A SURVEY OF THE COAST HATTERAS COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO CONSENT BUT SAID
8765-295009-0042 AND SUPPOSE THE MAN WON'T ALLOW HIS SHIP TO BE CUT UP IN THAT CASE YOU MUST TAKE THE LAW IN YOUR OWN HANDS AND BUILD A VESSEL IN SPITE OF HIM I WISH TO GOODNESS HE WOULD REFUSE THEN HE MUST BE ASKED BEFORE HE CAN REFUSE
8765-295009-0043 HE KEPT HIS WORD FOR THAT VERY SAME NIGHT AT SUPPER HE MANAGED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION TOWARDS THE SUBJECT OF MAKING EXCURSIONS DURING SUMMER FOR HYDROGRAPHICAL PURPOSES YOU WILL JOIN US I SUPPOSE ALTAMONT HE SAID OF COURSE REPLIED THE AMERICAN
8765-295009-0044 WE MUST KNOW HOW FAR NEW AMERICA EXTENDS HATTERAS LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIS RIVAL BUT SAID NOTHING
