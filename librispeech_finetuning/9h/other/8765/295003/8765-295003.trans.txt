8765-295003-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT AN EXCURSION TO THE NORTH OF VICTORIA BAY NEXT MORNING CLAWBONNY WAS OUT BY DAWN OF DAY CLAMBERING UP THE STEEP ROCKY WALL AGAINST WHICH THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE LEANED
8765-295003-0001 HE SUCCEEDED THOUGH WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN REACHING THE TOP WHICH HE FOUND TERMINATED ABRUPTLY IN A SORT OF TRUNCATED CONE
8765-295003-0002 FROM THIS ELEVATION THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE VIEW OVER A VAST TRACT OF COUNTRY WHICH WAS ALL DISORDERED AND CONVULSED AS IF IT HAD UNDERGONE SOME VOLCANIC COMMOTION
8765-295003-0003 WERE COVERED WITH A SHEET OF ICE A NEW PROJECT STRUCK THE DOCTOR'S MIND WHICH WAS SOON MATURED AND RIPE FOR EXECUTION HE LOST NO TIME IN GOING BACK TO THE SNOW HOUSE AND CONSULTING OVER IT WITH HIS COMPANIONS I HAVE GOT AN IDEA HE SAID
8765-295003-0004 I THINK OF CONSTRUCTING A LIGHTHOUSE ON THE TOP OF THAT CONE ABOVE OUR HEADS A LIGHTHOUSE THEY ALL EXCLAIMED YES A LIGHTHOUSE
8765-295003-0005 AND ALSO SERVE TO ILLUMINE OUR PLATEAU IN THE LONG DREARY WINTER MONTHS THERE IS NO DOUBT REPLIED ALTAMONT OF ITS UTILITY BUT HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIVE TO MAKE IT
8765-295003-0006 NO SEAL OIL WOULD NOT GIVE NEARLY SUFFICIENT LIGHT IT WOULD SCARCELY BE VISIBLE THROUGH THE FOG ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO MAKE GAS OUT OF OUR COAL THEN NO NOT THAT EITHER FOR GAS WOULD NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH AND WORSE STILL IT WOULD WASTE OUR COMBUSTIBLES
8765-295003-0007 WELL REPLIED ALTAMONT I'M AT A LOSS TO SEE HOW YOU OH I'M PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING AFTER THE MERCURY BULLET AND THE ICE LENS AND FORT PROVIDENCE I BELIEVE MISTER CLAWBONNY CAN DO ANYTHING EXCLAIMED JOHNSON
8765-295003-0008 COME CLAWBONNY TELL US WHAT YOUR LIGHT IS TO BE THEN SAID ALTAMONT THAT'S SOON TOLD REPLIED CLAWBONNY I MEAN TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AN ELECTRIC LIGHT YES WHY NOT HAVEN'T YOU A GALVANIC BATTERY ON BOARD YOUR SHIP YES
8765-295003-0009 WELL THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY THEN IN PRODUCING AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THAT WILL COST NOTHING AND BE FAR BRIGHTER FIRST RATE SAID JOHNSON LET US SET TO WORK AT ONCE BY ALL MEANS
8765-295003-0010 THERE IS PLENTY OF MATERIAL IN AN HOUR WE CAN RAISE A PILLAR OF ICE TEN FEET HIGH AND THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH AWAY WENT THE DOCTOR FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANIONS AND THE COLUMN WAS SOON ERECTED AND CROWNED WITH A SHIP LANTERN
8765-295003-0011 THE CONDUCTING WIRES WERE PROPERLY ADJUSTED WITHIN IT AND THE PILE WITH WHICH THEY COMMUNICATED FIXED UP IN THE SITTING ROOM WHERE THE WARMTH OF THE STOVE WOULD PROTECT IT FROM THE ACTION OF THE FROST AS SOON AS IT GREW DARK THE EXPERIMENT WAS MADE AND PROVED A COMPLETE SUCCESS
8765-295003-0012 AN INTENSE BRILLIANT LIGHT STREAMED FROM THE LANTERN AND ILLUMINED THE ENTIRE PLATEAU AND THE PLAINS BENEATH JOHNSON COULD NOT HELP CLAPPING HIS HANDS HALF BESIDE HIMSELF WITH DELIGHT WELL I DECLARE MISTER CLAWBONNY HE EXCLAIMED YOU'RE OUR SUN NOW
8765-295003-0013 ONE MUST BE A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING YOU KNOW WAS CLAWBONNY'S MODEST REPLY
8765-295003-0014 A REGULAR COURSE OF LIFE COMMENCED NOW THOUGH UNCERTAIN WEATHER AND FREQUENT CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE MADE IT SOMETIMES IMPRACTICABLE TO VENTURE OUTSIDE THE HUT AT ALL
8765-295003-0015 THEY STARTED VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING EACH ARMED WITH A DOUBLE BARRELLED GUN AND PLENTY OF POWDER AND SHOT
8765-295003-0016 AND THE BRIGHT RAYS OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT DID DUTY FOR THE GLORIOUS ORB OF DAY
8765-295003-0017 FOR THE LIGHT WAS EQUAL TO THREE THOUSAND CANDLES OR THREE HUNDRED GAS BURNERS IT WAS INTENSELY COLD BUT DRY AND THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO WIND THE HUNTERS SET OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF CAPE WASHINGTON
8765-295003-0018 AND THE HARD SNOW SO FAVOURED THEIR MARCH THAT IN THREE HOURS THEY HAD GONE FIFTEEN MILES DUK JUMPING AND BARKING BESIDE THEM ALL THE WAY
8765-295003-0019 BUT FOUND NO TRACE OF HUMAN HABITATION AND INDEED SCARCELY A SIGN OF ANIMAL LIFE A FEW SNOW BIRDS HOWEVER DARTING TO AND FRO ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF SPRING AND THE RETURN OF THE ANIMAL CREATION THE SEA WAS STILL ENTIRELY FROZEN OVER
8765-295003-0020 BUT IT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE OPEN BREATHING HOLES IN THE ICE THAT THE SEALS HAD BEEN QUITE RECENTLY ON THE SURFACE IN ONE PART THE HOLES WERE SO NUMEROUS THAT THE DOCTOR SAID TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT WHEN SUMMER CAME THEY WOULD BE SEEN
8765-295003-0021 THERE IN HUNDREDS AND WOULD BE EASILY CAPTURED FOR ON UNFREQUENTED SHORES THEY WERE NOT SO DIFFICULT OF APPROACH BUT ONCE FRIGHTEN THEM AND THEY ALL VANISH AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT AND NEVER RETURN TO THE SPOT AGAIN
8765-295003-0022 INEXPERIENCED HUNTERS HE SAID HAVE OFTEN LOST A WHOLE SHOAL BY ATTACKING THEM EN MASSE WITH NOISY SHOUTS INSTEAD OF SINGLY AND SILENTLY IS IT FOR THE OIL OR SKIN THAT THEY ARE MOSTLY HUNTED EUROPEANS HUNT THEM FOR THE SKIN
8765-295003-0023 THEY LIVE ON SEALS AND NOTHING IS SO DELICIOUS TO THEM AS A PIECE OF THE FLESH DIPPED IN THE BLOOD AND OIL
8765-295003-0024 AND I'LL BET YOU SOMETHING I COULD DRESS YOU CUTLETS YOU WOULD NOT TURN UP YOUR NOSE AT UNLESS FOR THEIR BLACK APPEARANCE WE'LL SET YOU TO WORK ON IT SAID BELL AND I'LL EAT AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE TO PLEASE YOU MY GOOD BELL
8765-295003-0025 YOU MEAN TO SAY TO PLEASE YOURSELF BUT YOUR VORACITY WOULD NEVER EQUAL THE GREEN LANDERS FOR THEY DEVOUR FROM TEN TO FIFTEEN POUNDS OF MEAT A DAY FIFTEEN POUNDS SAID BELL WHAT STOMACHS ARCTIC STOMACHS REPLIED THE DOCTOR ARE PRODIGIOUS
8765-295003-0026 THEY CAN EXPAND AT WILL AND I MAY ADD CONTRACT AT WILL SO THAT THEY CAN ENDURE STARVATION QUITE AS WELL AS ABUNDANCE WHEN AN ESQUIMAUX SITS DOWN TO DINNER HE IS QUITE THIN AND BY THE TIME HE HAS FINISHED HE IS SO CORPULENT YOU WOULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE HIM
8765-295003-0027 BUT THEN WE MUST REMEMBER THAT ONE MEAL SOMETIMES HAS TO LAST A WHOLE DAY THIS VORACITY MUST BE PECULIAR TO THE INHABITANTS OF COLD COUNTRIES SAID ALTAMONT I THINK IT IS REPLIED THE DOCTOR IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS PEOPLE MUST EAT ENORMOUSLY
8765-295003-0028 IT IS NOT ONLY ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF STRENGTH BUT OF EXISTENCE
8765-295003-0029 INVIGORATING REGIMEN CERTAINLY SAID BELL NOT SO MUCH AS YOU IMAGINE MY FRIEND AN INDIAN WHO GUZZLES LIKE THAT CAN'T DO A WHIT BETTER DAY'S WORK THAN AN ENGLISHMAN WHO HAS HIS POUND OF BEEF AND PINT OF BEER THINGS ARE BEST AS THEY ARE THEN MISTER CLAWBONNY
8765-295003-0030 NO DOUBT OF IT AND YET AN ESQUIMAUX MEAL MAY WELL ASTONISH US IN SIR JOHN ROSS'S NARRATIVE HE STATES HIS SURPRISE AT THE APPETITES OF HIS GUIDES HE TELLS US THAT TWO OF THEM JUST TWO MIND
8765-295003-0031 DEVOURED A QUARTER OF A BUFFALO IN ONE MORNING THEY CUT THE MEAT IN LONG NARROW STRIPS AND THE MODE OF EATING WAS EITHER FOR THE ONE TO BITE OFF AS MUCH AS HIS MOUTH COULD HOLD AND THEN PASS IT ON TO THE OTHER
8765-295003-0032 OR TO LEAVE THE LONG RIBBONS OF MEAT DANGLING FROM THE MOUTH AND DEVOUR THEM GRADUALLY LIKE BOA CONSTRICTORS
8765-295003-0033 EVERY MAN HAS HIS OWN FASHION OF DINING REMARKED THE PHILOSOPHICAL AMERICAN HAPPILY SAID THE DOCTOR WELL IF EATING IS SUCH AN IMPERATIVE NECESSITY IN THESE LATITUDES
8765-295003-0034 IT QUITE ACCOUNTS FOR ALL THE JOURNALS OF ARCTIC TRAVELLERS BEING SO FULL OF EATING AND DRINKING YOU ARE RIGHT RETURNED THE DOCTOR I HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE SAME FACT BUT I THINK IT ARISES NOT ONLY FROM THE NECESSITY OF FULL DIET BUT FROM THE EXTREME DIFFICULTY
8765-295003-0035 SOMETIMES IN PROCURING IT THE THOUGHT OF FOOD IS ALWAYS UPPERMOST IN THE MIND AND NATURALLY FINDS MENTION IN THE NARRATIVE AND YET SAID ALTAMONT IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT IN THE COLDEST PARTS OF NORWAY THE PEASANTS DO NOT SEEM TO NEED SUCH SUBSTANTIAL FARE
8765-295003-0036 MILK DIET IS THEIR STAPLE FOOD WITH EGGS AND BREAD MADE OF THE BARK OF THE BIRCH TREE A LITTLE SALMON OCCASIONALLY BUT NEVER MEAT AND STILL THEY ARE FINE HARDY FELLOWS IT IS AN AFFAIR OF ORGANIZATION OUT OF MY POWER TO EXPLAIN
8765-295003-0037 REPLIED CLAWBONNY BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IF THESE SAME NORWEGIANS WERE TRANSPLANTED TO GREENLAND
8765-295003-0038 EVEN IF WE OURSELVES WERE TO REMAIN IN THIS BLESSED COUNTRY LONG WE SHOULD BE AS BAD AS THE ESQUIMAUX EVEN IF WE ESCAPED BECOMING REGULAR GLUTTONS I DECLARE MISTER CLAWBONNY YOU MAKE ME FEEL HUNGRY WITH TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT EATING EXCLAIMED BELL
8765-295003-0039 NOT I SAID ALTAMONT IT RATHER SICKENS ME AND MAKES ME LOATHE THE SIGHT OF A SEAL BUT STOP I DO BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE CHANCE OF A DINNER OFF ONE FOR I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF THAT'S NOT SOMETHING ALIVE LYING ON THOSE LUMPS OF ICE YONDER
8765-295003-0040 IT IS A WALRUS EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR BE QUIET AND LET US GET UP TO HIM CLAWBONNY WAS RIGHT IT WAS A WALRUS OF HUGE DIMENSIONS DISPORTING HIMSELF NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
8765-295003-0041 THE HUNTERS SEPARATED GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SO AS TO SURROUND THE ANIMAL AND CUT OFF ALL RETREAT THEY CREPT ALONG CAUTIOUSLY BEHIND THE HUMMOCKS
8765-295003-0042 AND SOON LAY DEAD REDDENING THE ICE FIELD WITH HIS BLOOD IT WAS A FINE ANIMAL MEASURING MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN LENGTH
8765-295003-0043 BUT THE HUNTERS CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH CUTTING OFF THE MOST SAVOURY PARTS AND LEFT THE REST TO THE RAVENS WHICH HAD JUST BEGUN TO MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE
8765-295003-0044 THE MOON HAD NOT YET RISEN BUT THE SKY WAS SERENE AND CLOUDLESS AND ALREADY GLITTERING WITH STARS MAGNIFICENT STARS COME SAID THE DOCTOR LET US BE OFF FOR IT IS GETTING LATE
8765-295003-0045 LET US GO THE SHORTEST ROAD HOWEVER AND GET QUICKLY HOME WITHOUT LOSING OUR WAY THE STARS WILL GUIDE US THEY RESOLVED TO TRY A MORE DIRECT ROUTE BACK BY GOING FURTHER INLAND AND AVOIDING THE WINDINGS OF THE COAST
8765-295003-0046 THE QUESTION WAS RAISED WHETHER TO CONSTRUCT A HUT AND REST TILL MORNING OR PROCEED BUT CLAWBONNY INSISTED ON GOING ON AS HATTERAS AND JOHNSON WOULD BE SO UNEASY DUK WILL GUIDE US HE SAID HE WON'T GO WRONG
8765-295003-0047 HIS INSTINCT CAN DISPENSE WITH STAR AND COMPASS JUST LET US KEEP CLOSE BEHIND HIM
