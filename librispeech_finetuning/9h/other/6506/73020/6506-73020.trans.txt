6506-73020-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN COUNT PATEROFF AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SOME WEEKS DURING WHICH HARRY HAD BEEN DOWN AT CLAVERING AND HAD RETURNED AGAIN TO HIS WORK AT THE ADELPHI COUNT PATEROFF CALLED AGAIN IN BLOOMSBURY SQUARE BUT HARRY WAS AT MISTER BEILBY'S OFFICE
6506-73020-0001 HARRY AT ONCE RETURNED THE COUNT'S VISIT AT THE ADDRESS GIVEN IN MOUNT STREET MADAME WAS AT HOME SAID THE SERVANT GIRL FROM WHICH HARRY WAS LED TO SUPPOSE THAT THE COUNT WAS A MARRIED MAN BUT HARRY FELT THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO INTRUDE UPON MADAME SO HE SIMPLY LEFT HIS CARD
6506-73020-0002 WISHING HOWEVER REALLY TO HAVE THIS INTERVIEW AND HAVING BEEN LATELY ELECTED AT A CLUB OF WHICH HE WAS RATHER PROUD HE WROTE TO THE COUNT ASKING HIM TO DINE WITH HIM AT THE BEAUFORT HE EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A STRANGER'S ROOM WHICH PATEROFF KNEW VERY WELL HAVING OFTEN DINED AT THE BEAUFORT
6506-73020-0003 AND SAID SOMETHING AS TO A PRIVATE LITTLE DINNER FOR TWO THEREBY APOLOGIZING FOR PROPOSING TO THE COUNT TO DINE WITHOUT OTHER GUESTS PATEROFF ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND HARRY NEVER HAVING DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE ORDERED HIS DINNER WITH MUCH NERVOUSNESS
6506-73020-0004 THE COUNT WAS PUNCTUAL AND THE TWO MEN INTRODUCED THEMSELVES HARRY HAD EXPECTED TO SEE A HANDSOME FOREIGNER WITH BLACK HAIR POLISHED WHISKERS AND PROBABLY A HOOK NOSE FORTY YEARS OF AGE OR THEREABOUTS BUT SO GOT UP AS TO LOOK NOT MUCH MORE THAN THIRTY
6506-73020-0005 BUT HIS GUEST WAS BY NO MEANS A MAN OF THAT STAMP EXCEPTING THAT THE COUNT'S AGE WAS ALTOGETHER UNCERTAIN NO CORRECTNESS OF GUESS ON THAT MATTER BEING POSSIBLE BY MEANS OF HIS APPEARANCE HARRY'S PRECONCEIVED NOTION WAS WRONG IN EVERY POINT
6506-73020-0006 HE WAS A FAIR MAN WITH A BROAD FAIR FACE AND VERY LIGHT BLUE EYES HIS FOREHEAD WAS LOW BUT BROAD HE WORE NO WHISKERS BUT BORE ON HIS LIP A HEAVY MOUSTACHE WHICH WAS NOT GRAY BUT PERFECTLY WHITE WHITE IT WAS WITH YEARS OF COURSE
6506-73020-0007 BUT YET IT GAVE NO SIGN OF AGE TO HIS FACE HE WAS WELL MADE ACTIVE AND SOMEWHAT BROAD IN THE SHOULDERS THOUGH RATHER BELOW THE MIDDLE HEIGHT
6506-73020-0008 ACCOMPANIED BY SOMETHING OF RESTLESSNESS IN HIS EYE
6506-73020-0009 AND HIS SPEECH HARDLY BETRAYED THAT HE WAS NOT ENGLISH HARRY KNOWING THAT HE WAS A FOREIGNER NOTICED NOW AND AGAIN SOME LITTLE ACQUIRED DISTINCTNESS OF SPEECH WHICH IS HARDLY NATURAL TO A NATIVE BUT OTHERWISE THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS TONGUE TO BETRAY HIM
6506-73020-0010 SHAKING HANDS WITH HARRY CLAVERING DECLARED THAT HE HAD INCURRED NO TROUBLE AND DECLARED ALSO THAT HE WOULD BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO HAVE TAKEN ANY TROUBLE IN OBEYING A BEHEST FROM HIS FRIEND LADY ONGAR HAD HE BEEN A POLE AS WAS THE COUNT HE WOULD NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN TO ADD
6506-73020-0011 BUT BEING SIMPLY A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN HE WAS MUCH TOO AWKWARD FOR ANY SUCH COURTESY AS THAT THE COUNT OBSERVED THE OMISSION SMILED AND BOWED
6506-73020-0012 AND SAID THAT LONDON WAS A MAGNIFICENT CITY OH YES HE KNEW LONDON WELL HAD KNOWN IT THESE TWENTY YEARS HAD BEEN FOR FIFTEEN YEARS A MEMBER OF THE TRAVELLERS HE LIKED EVERYTHING ENGLISH EXCEPT HUNTING ENGLISH HUNTING HE HAD FOUND TO BE DULL WORK
6506-73020-0013 BUT HE LIKED SHOOTING FOR AN HOUR OR TWO HE COULD NOT RIVAL HE SAID THE INTENSE ENERGY OF AN ENGLISHMAN WHO WOULD WORK ALL DAY WITH HIS GUN HARDER THAN PLOUGHMEN WITH THEIR PLOUGHS ENGLISHMEN SPORTED HE SAID AS THOUGH MORE THAN THEIR BREAD AS THOUGH THEIR HONOR
6506-73020-0014 THEIR WIVES THEIR SOULS DEPENDED ON IT IT WAS VERY FINE HE OFTEN WISHED THAT HE WAS AN ENGLISHMAN THEN HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HARRY WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO COMMENCE A CONVERSATION ABOUT LADY ONGAR
6506-73020-0015 BUT HE DID NOT KNOW HOW AT FIRST TO INTRODUCE HER NAME COUNT PATEROFF HAD COME TO HIM AT LADY ONGAR'S REQUEST AND THEREFORE AS HE THOUGHT THE COUNT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO MENTION HER BUT THE COUNT SEEMED TO BE ENJOYING HIS DINNER WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT
6506-73020-0016 EITHER OF LADY ONGAR OR OF HER LATE HUSBAND AT THIS TIME HE HAD BEEN DOWN TO ONGAR PARK ON THAT MISSION WHICH HAD BEEN AS WE KNOW FUTILE BUT HE SAID NO WORD OF THAT TO HARRY HE SEEMED TO ENJOY HIS DINNER THOROUGHLY AND MADE HIMSELF VERY AGREEABLE
6506-73020-0017 WHEN THE WINE WAS DISCUSSED HE TOLD HARRY THAT A CERTAIN VINTAGE OF MOSELLE WAS VERY FAMOUS AT THE BEAUFORT HARRY ORDERED THE WINE OF COURSE AND WAS DELIGHTED TO GIVE HIS GUEST THE BEST OF EVERYTHING BUT HE WAS A LITTLE ANNOYED AT FINDING THAT THE STRANGER KNEW HIS CLUB
6506-73020-0018 BETTER THAN HE KNEW IT HIMSELF SLOWLY THE COUNT ATE HIS DINNER ENJOYING EVERY MORSEL THAT HE TOOK WITH THAT THOUGHTFUL CONSCIOUS PLEASURE WHICH YOUNG MEN NEVER ATTAIN IN EATING AND DRINKING AND WHICH MEN AS THEY GROW OLDER SO OFTEN FORGET TO ACQUIRE
6506-73020-0019 BUT THE COUNT NEVER FORGOT ANY OF HIS OWN CAPACITIES FOR PLEASURE AND IN ALL THINGS MADE THE MOST OF HIS OWN RESOURCES TO BE RICH IS NOT TO HAVE ONE OR TEN THOUSAND A YEAR BUT TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THAT ONE OR TEN THOUSAND
6506-73020-0020 ALL THAT EVERY POUND AND EVERY SHILLING AND EVERY PENNY WILL GIVE YOU AFTER THIS FASHION THE COUNT WAS A RICH MAN YOU DON'T SIT AFTER DINNER HERE I SUPPOSE SAID THE COUNT WHEN HE HAD COMPLETED AN ELABORATE WASHING OF HIS MOUTH AND MOUSTACHE
6506-73020-0021 I LIKE THIS CLUB BECAUSE WE WHO ARE STRANGERS HAVE SO CHARMING A ROOM FOR OUR SMOKING IT IS THE BEST CLUB IN LONDON FOR MEN WHO DO NOT BELONG TO IT IT OCCURRED TO HARRY THAT IN THE SMOKING ROOM THERE COULD BE NO PRIVACY
6506-73020-0022 THREE OR FOUR MEN HAD ALREADY SPOKEN TO THE COUNT SHOWING THAT HE WAS WELL KNOWN GIVING NOTICE AS IT WERE THAT PATEROFF WOULD BECOME A PUBLIC MAN WHEN ONCE HE WAS PLACED IN A PUBLIC CIRCLE TO HAVE GIVEN A DINNER TO THE COUNT
6506-73020-0023 WOULD BE BY NO MEANS SATISFACTORY TO HARRY'S FEELINGS THOUGH AS IT APPEARED IT MIGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY SATISFACTORY TO THE GUEST HARRY THEREFORE SUGGESTED ONE BOTTLE OF CLARET THE COUNT AGREED
6506-73020-0024 EXPRESSING AN OPINION THAT THE FIFTY ONE LAFITTE WAS UNEXCEPTIONAL THE FIFTY ONE LAFITTE WAS ORDERED AND HARRY AS HE FILLED HIS GLASS CONSIDERED THE WAY IN WHICH HIS SUBJECT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED YOU KNEW LORD ONGAR I THINK ABROAD
6506-73020-0025 LORD ONGAR ABROAD OH YES VERY WELL AND FOR MANY YEARS HERE IN LONDON AND AT VIENNA AND VERY EARLY IN LIFE AT SAINT PETERSBURG I KNEW LORD ONGAR FIRST IN RUSSIA WHEN HE WAS ATTACHED TO THE EMBASSY AS FREDERIC COURTON
6506-73020-0026 HIS FATHER LORD COURTON WAS THEN ALIVE AS WAS ALSO HIS GRANDFATHER HE WAS A NICE GOOD LOOKING LAD THEN AS REGARDS HIS BEING NICE
6506-73020-0027 THIS THE COUNT NOTICED BY SIMPLY SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND SMILING AS HE SIPPED HIS WINE BY ALL THAT I CAN HEAR HE BECAME A HORRID BRUTE WHEN HE MARRIED SAID HARRY ENERGETICALLY HE WAS NOT PLEASANT WHEN HE WAS ILL AT FLORENCE SAID THE COUNT
6506-73020-0028 SHE MUST HAVE HAD A TERRIBLE TIME WITH HIM SAID HARRY THE COUNT PUT UP HIS HANDS AGAIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND THEN SHOOK HIS HEAD SHE KNEW HE WAS NO LONGER AN ADONIS WHEN HE MARRIED HER AN ADONIS NO
6506-73020-0029 SHE DID NOT EXPECT AN ADONIS BUT SHE THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE SOMETHING OF THE HONOR AND FEELINGS OF A MAN SHE FOUND IT UNCOMFORTABLE NO DOUBT HE DID TOO MUCH OF THIS YOU KNOW SAID THE COUNT RAISING HIS GLASS TO HIS LIPS AND HE DIDN'T DO IT WITH FIFTY ONE LAFITTE
6506-73020-0030 THAT WAS ONGAR'S FAULT ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS NO ONE KNEW IT BETTER THAN HUGH CLAVERING BUT SAID HARRY AND THEN HE STOPPED HE HARDLY KNEW WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WISHED TO LEARN FROM THE MAN THOUGH HE CERTAINLY DID WISH TO LEARN SOMETHING
6506-73020-0031 HE HAD THOUGHT THAT THE COUNT WOULD HIMSELF HAVE TALKED ABOUT LADY ONGAR AND THOSE FLORENTINE DAYS BUT THIS HE DID NOT SEEM DISPOSED TO DO SHALL WE HAVE OUR CIGARS NOW SAID COUNT PATEROFF ONE MOMENT IF YOU DON'T MIND CERTAINLY CERTAINLY THERE IS NO HURRY
6506-73020-0032 YOU WILL TAKE NO MORE WINE NO MORE WINE I TAKE MY WINE AT DINNER AS YOU SAW I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE SPECIAL QUESTION ABOUT LADY ONGAR
6506-73020-0033 I WILL SAY ANYTHING IN HER FAVOR THAT YOU PLEASE I AM ALWAYS READY TO SAY ANYTHING IN THE FAVOR OF ANY LADY AND IF NEEDS BE
6506-73020-0034 HARRY WAS SHARP ENOUGH TO PERCEIVE THAT ANY ASSERTION MADE UNDER SUCH A STIPULATION WAS WORSE THAN NOTHING IT WAS AS WHEN A MAN IN DENYING THE TRUTH OF A STATEMENT DOES SO WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT ON THAT SUBJECT
6506-73020-0035 HE SHOULD CONSIDER HIMSELF JUSTIFIED IN TELLING ANY NUMBER OF LIES I DID NOT WRITE THE BOOK
6506-73020-0036 AND I SHOULD SAY THAT I HAD NOT EVEN IF I HAD PATEROFF WAS SPEAKING OF LADY ONGAR IN THIS WAY AND HARRY HATED HIM FOR DOING SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO SAY ANY GOOD OF HER SAID HE OR ANY EVIL I CERTAINLY SHALL SAY NO EVIL OF HER
6506-73020-0037 BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAS BEEN MOST CRUELLY TREATED WELL THERE IS ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR I THINK SEVEN THOUSAND A YEAR NOT FRANCS BUT POUNDS WE POOR FOREIGNERS LOSE OURSELVES IN AMAZEMENT WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT YOUR ENGLISH FORTUNES
6506-73020-0038 SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR FOR A LADY ALL ALONE AND A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE A HOUSE SO BEAUTIFUL THEY TELL ME WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT SAID HARRY WHEREUPON THE COUNT AGAIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT
6506-73020-0039 BECAUSE THE MAN WAS RICH HE WAS NOT JUSTIFIED IN ILL TREATING HIS WIFE DID HE NOT BRING FALSE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HER IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT ROB HER AFTER HIS DEATH OF ALL THAT OF WHICH YOU THINK SO MUCH DID HE NOT HEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST HER TO HIS OWN DISHONOR
6506-73020-0040 BUT HER NAME HAS BEEN COVERED WITH LIES WHAT CAN I DO
6506-73020-0041 I KNOW NOTHING LOOK HERE MISTER CLAVERING IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY INQUIRY YOU HAD BETTER GO TO MY SISTER I DON'T SEE WHAT GOOD IT WILL DO
6506-73020-0042 LET US SMOKE YOUR SISTER YES MY SISTER MADAME GORDELOUP IS HER NAME HAS NOT LADY ONGAR MENTIONED MY SISTER THEY ARE INSEPARABLES MY SISTER LIVES IN MOUNT STREET WITH YOU NO NOT WITH ME
6506-73020-0043 I DO NOT LIVE IN MOUNT STREET I HAVE MY ADDRESS SOMETIMES AT HER HOUSE MADAME GORDELOUP YES MADAME GORDELOUP SHE IS LADY ONGAR'S FRIEND SHE WILL TALK TO YOU WILL YOU INTRODUCE ME COUNT PATEROFF OH NO IT IS NOT NECESSARY
6506-73020-0044 YOU CAN GO TO MOUNT STREET AND SHE WILL BE DELIGHTED THERE IS THE CARD AND NOW WE WILL SMOKE HARRY FELT THAT HE COULD NOT WITH GOOD BREEDING DETAIN THE COUNT ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR LED THE WAY INTO THE SMOKING ROOM
6506-73020-0045 WHEN THERE THE MAN OF THE WORLD SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM HIS YOUNG FRIEND OF WHOSE ENTHUSIASM HE HAD PERHAPS HAD ENOUGH AND WAS SOON ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH SUNDRY OTHER MEN OF HIS OWN STANDING HARRY SOON PERCEIVED THAT HIS GUEST HAD NO FURTHER NEED OF HIS COUNTENANCE
6506-73020-0046 ON THE NEXT DAY HE DINED IN ONSLOW CRESCENT WITH THE BURTONS AND WHEN THERE HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT LADY ONGAR OR COUNT PATEROFF HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT HE HAD ANY SPECIAL REASON FOR BEING SILENT ON THE SUBJECT
6506-73020-0047 BUT HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT THE BURTONS WERE PEOPLE SO FAR REMOVED IN THEIR SPHERE OF LIFE FROM LADY ONGAR THAT THE SUBJECT WOULD NOT BE SUITABLE IN ONSLOW CRESCENT IT WAS HIS LOT IN LIFE TO BE CONCERNED WITH PEOPLE OF THE TWO CLASSES HE DID NOT AT ALL MEAN TO SAY
6506-73020-0048 EVEN TO HIMSELF THAT HE LIKED THE ONGAR CLASS BETTER BUT STILL AS SUCH WAS HIS LOT HE MUST TAKE IT AS IT CAME AND ENTERTAIN BOTH SUBJECTS OF INTEREST WITHOUT ANY COMMINGLING OF THEM
6506-73020-0049 OF LADY ONGAR AND HIS EARLY LOVE HE HAD SPOKEN TO FLORENCE AT SOME LENGTH BUT HE DID NOT FIND IT NECESSARY IN HIS LETTERS
6506-73020-0050 AND HIS DINNER AT THE BEAUFORT NOR DID HE MENTION THE DINNER TO HIS DEAR FRIEND CECILIA
