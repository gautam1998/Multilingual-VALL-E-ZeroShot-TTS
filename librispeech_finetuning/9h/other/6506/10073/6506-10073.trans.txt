6506-10073-0014 IN FACT SHE HAS GONE TO UNDO WHAT YOU DID IF SHE CAN ONLY SUCCEED IN MAKING THE MAN KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT IT FREE FROM ALL LIES SHE'LL DO WHAT SHE'S GONE TO DO WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN BY LIES SAID SIR FRANCIS RISING IN WRATH FROM HIS CHAIR
6506-10073-0015 WELL LIES MEAN LIES AS I HAVEN'T APPLIED THE WORD TO ANYONE I SUPPOSE I MAY BE ALLOWED TO USE IT AND TO STAND BY IT I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHAT LIES MEAN AND I SUPPOSE YOU ARE AWARE THAT WESTERN HAS BEEN MADE TO BELIEVE LIES ABOUT HIS WIFE WHO TOLD THEM
6506-10073-0016 I SAY NOTHING ABOUT THAT SAID DICK LIES ARE A SORT OF THING WHICH ARE VERY COMMONLY TOLD AND ARE ORDINARILY ASCRIBED TO THE WORLD AT LARGE THE WORLD NEVER QUARRELS WITH THE ACCUSATION THE WORLD HAS TOLD MOST INFERNAL LIES TO THIS MAN ABOUT HIS WIFE
6506-10073-0017 I DON'T SUPPOSE THE WORLD MEANS TO CALL ME OUT FOR SAYING AS MUCH AS THAT THEN THE TWO REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME MOMENTS AND DICK PROCEEDED WITH HIS ELOQUENCE
6506-10073-0018 HAD A MAN OR A WOMAN IT'S ALL ONE GONE TO THAT POOR CREATURE WITH A PISTOL IN HIS HAND AND BLOWN HER BRAINS OUT HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE A MORE DASTARDLY ACTION WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN BY THAT SAID THE OTHER I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU SPECIALLY
6506-10073-0019 I SAY LIES HAVE BEEN TOLD BUT I DO NOT SAY WHO HAS TOLD THEM I RATHER SUSPECT A WOMAN TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF IT SIR FRANCIS WHO HAD IN HIS POCKET A MOST TENDER AND LOVING REPLY FROM MISS ALTIFIORLA
6506-10073-0020 THAT MAN HAS BEEN MADE TO BELIEVE CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT HIS WIFE WHICH ARE ALL LIES LIES FROM BEGINNING TO END HE HAS BEEN MADE TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO ME FIRST IS THAT A LIE THAT DEPENDS ON THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS TOLD HE DIDN'T SEND HER HOME MERELY FOR THAT
6506-10073-0021 BUT THEY WERE DAMNABLE LIES YOU SOMETIMES TELL ME THAT I AIN'T ANY BETTER THAN ANOTHER OR GENERALLY A GREAT DEAL WORSE BUT I'D RATHER HAVE BLOWN MY BRAINS OUT THAN HAVE TOLD SUCH LIES ABOUT A WOMAN AS HAVE BEEN TOLD HERE BY SOMEBODY YOU ASK ME WHAT THEY WERE SAYING AT THE CLUB IN PERTH
6506-10073-0022 NOW YOU KNOW IT PRETTY WELL ALL IT MUST BE SUPPOSED THAT WHAT HAD PASSED AT THE CLUB HAD INDUCED DICK TO DETERMINE THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER BECOME HIM TO REMAIN WITH SIR FRANCIS AS HIS HUMBLE FRIEND VERY EVIL THINGS HAD IN TRUTH BEEN SAID OF SIR FRANCIS
6506-10073-0023 AND THEY WERE MORE THAN DICK COULD ENDURE THE NATURAL INDIGNATION OF THE MAN WAS AROUSED SO THAT BY DEGREES IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HE HATED THE BARONET HE HAD BEFORE SAID VERY SHARP WORDS TO HIM BUT HAD NOW GONE HOME RESOLVED IN HIS RIGHTEOUS MIND TO BRING THINGS TO A CONCLUSION
6506-10073-0024 BUT THEY WERE OF A NATURE TO FILL HIS MIND WITH RIGHTEOUS WRATH AND TO PRODUCE FROM HIM THE ELOQUENCE ABOVE DESCRIBED SIR FRANCIS WHOSE VANITY HAD BEEN CHARMED BY THE LETTER WHICH HE KEPT IN HIS POCKET HAD ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND TO PART WITH DICK
6506-10073-0025 BUT DICK'S WORDS AS NOW SPOKEN LEFT HIM NO ALTERNATIVE IT WAS A QUESTION WITH HIM WHETHER HE COULD NOT SO PART WITH HIM AS TO INFLICT SOME FURTHER PUNISHMENT WHY DICK HE SAID SMILING YOU HAVE BROKEN OUT QUITE IN A NEW PLACE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT
6506-10073-0026 YOU MUST HAVE BEEN WITH THE BISHOP AND TAKEN A LESSON IN PREACHING I NEVER HEARD YOU COME OUT SO STRONG BEFORE I WISH YOU'D HEARD WHAT SOME OF THOSE MEN AT PERTH SAID ABOUT YOU AND HOW YOU ANSWERED THEM AS MY FRIEND AS FAR AS I REMEMBER I DIDN'T SAY MUCH MYSELF
6506-10073-0027 WHAT I DID SAY CERTAINLY WAS NOT IN YOUR FAVOUR BUT I WAS HARDEST ON THAT SWEET YOUNG LADY WITH THE ITALIAN NAME YOU WON'T MIND THAT BECAUSE YOU AND SHE ARE TWO NOW CAN YOU TELL ME ROSS
6506-10073-0028 I SUPPOSE I COULD OR HOW MUCH YOU HAVE DRANK OF MY WINE I HAVEN'T MADE A CALCULATION OF THAT NATURE IT ISN'T USUAL FOR SHOOTING HERE HOW MUCH HAVE YOU EVER CONTRIBUTED WHEN I SHOOT I CONTRIBUTE NOTHING
6506-10073-0029 ALL THE WORLD UNDERSTANDS THAT HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU OWE ME I OWE YOU NOTHING THAT I'VE EVER PROMISED TO PAY
6506-10073-0030 WHICH YOU HAVE HEARD FROM ME IN CONFIDENCE I DON'T I THINK IT A VERY A VERY WHAT SIR FRANCIS I HAVE NOT DONE AS YOU ALLEGE BUT YOU WERE GOING TO OBSERVE A VERY WHAT WAS IT
6506-10073-0031 IT MUST BE HERE EXPLAINED THAT DICK ROSS WAS NOT A MAN WHO FEARED MANY THINGS BUT THAT SIR FRANCIS FEARED MUCH DICK HAD LITTLE TO LOSE BY A ROW WHEREAS THE BARONET WOULD BE INJURED THE BARONET THEREFORE DECLINED TO FILL IN THE EPITHET WHICH HE HAD OMITTED
6506-10073-0032 HE KNEW FROM FORMER EXPERIENCE WHAT DICK WOULD AND WHAT HE WOULD NOT BEAR I DON'T CHOOSE TO DESCEND TO BILLINGSGATE SAID SIR FRANCIS
6506-10073-0033 VERY GENTLEMANLIKE ISN'T IT SAID DICK WITH A SMILE MEANING THEREBY TO IMPUTE IT TO SIR FRANCIS AS COWARDICE THAT HE WAS UNWILLING TO SAY THE REVERSE BUT UNDER ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES
6506-10073-0034 YOU MUST FEEL THAT YOURSELF OH QUITE SO
6506-10073-0035 PERHAPS TO MORROW WILL DO JUST AS YOU PLEASE THEN I SHALL BE ABLE TO ADD A FEW DROPS TO ALL THOSE BUCKETS OF CLARET WHICH YOU THREW IN MY TEETH JUST NOW I WONDER WHETHER ANY GENTLEMAN WAS EVER BEFORE ASKED BY ANOTHER GENTLEMAN
6506-10073-0036 WHEN YOU ASKED ME DID YOU EXPECT ME TO PAY FOR MY DINNERS AND WINE SIR FRANCIS REFUSED TO MAKE ANY REPLY TO THIS QUESTION AND WHEN YOU DELICATELY HINTED AT MY POVERTY HAD YOU FOUND MY FINANCES TO BE LOWER THAN YOU'D ALWAYS KNOWN THEM
6506-10073-0037 IT IS DISAGREEABLE TO BE A PENNILESS YOUNGER BROTHER I HAVE FOUND IT SO ALL MY LIFE AND I ADMIT THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE EARNED MY BREAD
6506-10073-0038 PEOPLE MAY DECLARE THAT I AM GOOD FOR NOTHING AND MAY HOLD ME UP AS AN EXAMPLE TO BE SHUNNED BUT I FLATTER MYSELF THAT NOBODY HAS CALLED ME A BLACKGUARD I HAVE TOLD NO LIES TO INJURE MEN BEHIND THEIR BACKS MUCH LESS HAVE I DONE SO TO INJURE A WOMAN
6506-10073-0039 I HAVE SACRIFICED NO GIRL TO MY REVENGE SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE HAS THROWN ME OVER IN THE LITTLE TRANSACTIONS I HAVE HAD I HAVE ALWAYS RUN STRAIGHT
6506-10073-0040 AND NOT ADD ANYTHING TO THE BUCKET OF CLARET JUST AS YOU PLEASE SAID SIR FRANCIS THEN DICK ROSS LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT AWAY TO MAKE SUCH ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIS DEPARTURE AS WERE POSSIBLE TO HIM AND THE READERS OF THIS STORY SHALL SEE HIM AND HEAR HIM NO MORE
6506-10073-0041 SIR FRANCIS WHEN HE WAS LEFT ALONE TOOK OUT MISS ALTIFIORLA'S LETTER AND READ IT AGAIN HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD ASSUME GRAND MANNERS IN HIS PERSONAL INTERCOURSE WITH WOMEN
6506-10073-0042 HE LOVED TO BE FLATTERED AND WAS PRONE TO BELIEVE ANYTHING GOOD OF HIMSELF THAT WAS SAID TO HIM BY ONE OF THEM HE THEREFORE TOOK THE FOLLOWING LETTER FOR MORE THAN IT WAS WORTH MY DEAR SIR FRANCIS I KNOW THAT YOU WILL HAVE BEEN QUITE QUICK ENOUGH TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHEN YOU RECEIVED MY FORMER LITTLE SCRAWL
6506-10073-0043 WHAT MY ANSWER WOULD BE WHEN A WOMAN ATTEMPTS TO DECEIVE A MAN IN SUCH A MATTER SHE KNOWS BEFOREHAND THAT THE ATTEMPT WILL BE VAIN AND I CERTAINLY DID NOT THINK THAT I COULD SUCCEED WITH YOU BUT YET A FEELING OF SHAMEFACEDNESS WHAT SOME LADIES CONSIDER AS MODESTY
6506-10073-0044 FORCED ME INTO TEMPORARY SILENCE WHAT COULD I WISH BETTER THAN TO BE LOVED BY SUCH A ONE AS YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS THE RANK WHICH GOES FOR MUCH WITH ME THEN THERE IS THE MONEY WHICH I ADMIT COUNTS FOR SOMETHING
6506-10073-0045 THEN THERE ARE THE MANNERS AND THE PECULIAR STATION BEFORE THE WORLD WHICH IS QUITE SEPARATE FROM THE RANK TO ME THESE ALONE ARE IRRESISTIBLE SHALL I SAY TOO THAT PERSONAL APPEARANCE DOES COUNT FOR MUCH I CAN FANCY MYSELF MARRYING AN UGLY MAN
6506-10073-0046 BUT I CAN FANCY ALSO THAT I COULD NOT DO IT WITHOUT SOMETHING OF DISGUST MISS ALTIFIORLA WHEN SHE WROTE THIS HAD UNDERSTOOD WELL THAT VANITY AND LOVE OF FLATTERY WERE CONSPICUOUS TRAITS IN THE CHARACTER OF HER ADMIRER HAVING OWNED SO MUCH
6506-10073-0047 WHAT IS THERE MORE TO SAY THAN THAT I AM THE HAPPIEST WOMAN BETWEEN THE SEAS THE READER MUST BE HERE TOLD THAT THIS LETTER HAD BEEN COPIED OUT A SECOND TIME BECAUSE IN THE FIRST COPY SHE HAD ALLOWED THE WORD GIRL TO PASS IN THE ABOVE SENTENCE SOMETHING TOLD HER
6506-10073-0048 THAT SHE HAD BETTER WRITE WOMAN INSTEAD AND SHE HAD WRITTEN IT WHAT MORE IS THERE FOR ME TO ADD TO THE ABOVE EXCEPT TO TELL YOU THAT I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART MONTHS AGO IT SEEMS TO BE YEARS NOW WHEN CECILIA HOLT HAD CAUGHT YOUR FANCY
6506-10073-0049 I DID REGARD HER AS THE MOST FORTUNATE GIRL BUT I DID NOT REGARD YOU AS THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
6506-10073-0050 WHICH WOULD NOT SUIT THERE IS AN ASPERITY RATHER THAN STRICTNESS ABOUT HER WHICH I KNEW YOUR SPIRIT WOULD NOT BROOK SHE WOULD HAVE BORNE THE BATTLINGS WHICH WOULD HAVE ARISEN WITH AN EQUAL TEMPER SHE CAN INDEED BEAR ALL THINGS WITH EQUANIMITY AS SHE DOES HER PRESENT POSITION BUT YOU
6506-10073-0051 WOULD STILL HAVE SUFFERED I DO NOT THINK THAT THE WIFE YOU NOW DESIRE IS ONE WITH WHOM YOU WILL HAVE TO WAGE WAR SHALL I SAY THAT IF YOU MARRY HER WHOM YOU HAVE NOW ASKED TO JOIN HER LOT WITH YOURS THERE WILL BE NO SUCH FIGHTING
6506-10073-0052 BUT WITH YOU I SHALL ONLY ATTEMPT TO HOLD MY OWN BY MAKING MYSELF ONE WITH YOU IN ALL YOUR DESIRES AND ASPIRATIONS I AM YOURS WITH ALL MY HEART WITH ALL MY BODY AND SOUL FRANCESCA
6506-10073-0053 BUT I HOPE IT WILL PLEASE YOUR HIGHNESS TO VISIT YOUR MOST WORTHY CLERICAL RELATIONS IN THIS CATHEDRAL CITY BEFORE LONG I SHALL SAY NOTHING TO ANY OF YOUR CLERICAL RELATIONS AS TO MY PROSPECTS IN LIFE UNTIL I SHALL HAVE RECEIVED YOUR SANCTION FOR DOING SO BUT THE SOONER I DO RECEIVE IT
6506-10073-0054 THE BETTER FOR MY PEACE OF MIND SIR FRANCIS WAS UPON THE WHOLE DELIGHTED WITH THE LETTER AND THE MORE DELIGHTED AS HE NOW READ IT FOR THE THIRD TIME
6506-10073-0055 IT WAS THUS THAT HE SPOKE TO HIMSELF ABOUT THE LETTER AS HE SUCKED IN THE FLATTERY IT WAS THUS THAT MISS ALTIFIORLA HAD INTENDED THAT HE SHOULD RECEIVE IT SHE KNEW HERSELF TOO WELL TO SUSPECT THAT HER FLATTERY SHOULD FAIL NOT A WORD OF IT FAILED
6506-10073-0056 IN NOTHING WAS HE MORE GRATIFIED THAN IN HER ALLUSIONS TO HIS MATRIMONIAL EFFORTS WITH MISS HOLT SHE HAD ASSURED HIM
6506-10073-0057 BUT SHE HAD AT THE SAME TIME TOLD HIM OF THE EXTREME TENDERNESS OF HIS HEART HE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVED HER WHEN SHE WHISPERED TO HIM HER SECRET THAT SHE HAD ENVIED CECILIA HER LOT WHEN CECILIA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE HAPPY BRIDE
6506-10073-0058 AND HER ASSURANCE THAT SHE WOULD NEVER INTERFERE WITH HIM
