978-132494-0017 IT'S OUT OF PROPORTION WITH OTHER QUALITIES OF YOUR HEART AND CHARACTER WHICH I FLATTER MYSELF I HAVE TO SOME EXTENT DIVINED OF COURSE I DID REFLECT EVEN THEN THAT IT DOES NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN THAT A MAN GETS UP AND BLURTS OUT HIS WHOLE STORY IT DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES
978-132494-0018 IF YOU MAKE A MAN LOSE ALL PATIENCE THOUGH EVEN THEN IT'S RARE I WAS CAPABLE OF REALISING THAT IF I ONLY HAD A FACT I THOUGHT THE LEAST LITTLE FACT TO GO UPON SOMETHING I COULD LAY HOLD OF SOMETHING TANGIBLE NOT MERELY PSYCHOLOGICAL
978-132494-0019 ONE MAY RECKON UPON MOST SURPRISING RESULTS INDEED I WAS RECKONING ON YOUR TEMPERAMENT RODION ROMANOVITCH ON YOUR TEMPERAMENT ABOVE ALL THINGS I HAD GREAT HOPES OF YOU AT THAT TIME BUT WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT NOW
978-132494-0020 RASKOLNIKOV MUTTERED AT LAST ASKING THE QUESTION WITHOUT THINKING WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT HE WONDERED DISTRACTEDLY DOES HE REALLY TAKE ME TO BE INNOCENT WHAT AM I DRIVING AT I'VE COME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF
978-132494-0021 I CONSIDER IT MY DUTY SO TO SPEAK I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR TO YOU HOW THE WHOLE BUSINESS THE WHOLE MISUNDERSTANDING AROSE I'VE CAUSED YOU A GREAT DEAL OF SUFFERING RODION ROMANOVITCH
978-132494-0022 I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MUST MEAN FOR A MAN WHO HAS BEEN UNFORTUNATE BUT WHO IS PROUD IMPERIOUS AND ABOVE ALL IMPATIENT TO HAVE TO BEAR SUCH TREATMENT I REGARD YOU IN ANY CASE AS A MAN OF NOBLE CHARACTER AND NOT WITHOUT ELEMENTS OF MAGNANIMITY

978-132494-0025 IT'S SCARCELY NECESSARY TO GO OVER EVERYTHING IN DETAIL PORFIRY PETROVITCH WENT ON INDEED I COULD SCARCELY ATTEMPT IT TO BEGIN WITH THERE WERE RUMOURS THROUGH WHOM HOW AND WHEN THOSE RUMOURS CAME TO ME
978-132494-0026 AND HOW THEY AFFECTED YOU I NEED NOT GO INTO MY SUSPICIONS WERE AROUSED BY A COMPLETE ACCIDENT WHICH MIGHT JUST AS EASILY NOT HAVE HAPPENED
978-132494-0027 I BELIEVE THERE IS NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT EITHER THOSE RUMOURS AND THAT ACCIDENT LED TO ONE IDEA IN MY MIND I ADMIT IT OPENLY FOR ONE MAY AS WELL MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT I WAS THE FIRST TO PITCH ON YOU
978-132494-0028 THE OLD WOMAN'S NOTES ON THE PLEDGES AND THE REST OF IT THAT ALL CAME TO NOTHING YOURS WAS ONE OF A HUNDRED I HAPPENED TOO TO HEAR OF THE SCENE AT THE OFFICE FROM A MAN WHO DESCRIBED IT CAPITALLY UNCONSCIOUSLY REPRODUCING THE SCENE WITH GREAT VIVIDNESS
978-132494-0029 HOW COULD I AVOID BEING BROUGHT TO CERTAIN IDEAS FROM A HUNDRED RABBITS YOU CAN'T MAKE A HORSE A HUNDRED SUSPICIONS DON'T MAKE A PROOF AS THE ENGLISH PROVERB SAYS BUT THAT'S ONLY FROM THE RATIONAL POINT OF VIEW YOU CAN'T HELP BEING PARTIAL FOR AFTER ALL A LAWYER IS ONLY HUMAN
978-132494-0030 I THOUGHT TOO OF YOUR ARTICLE IN THAT JOURNAL DO YOU REMEMBER ON YOUR FIRST VISIT WE TALKED OF IT
978-132494-0031 BUT THAT WAS ONLY TO LEAD YOU ON I REPEAT RODION ROMANOVITCH YOU ARE ILL AND IMPATIENT THAT YOU WERE BOLD HEADSTRONG IN EARNEST AND HAD FELT A GREAT DEAL I RECOGNISED LONG BEFORE I TOO HAVE FELT THE SAME
978-132494-0032 I JEERED AT YOU THEN BUT LET ME TELL YOU THAT AS A LITERARY AMATEUR I AM AWFULLY FOND OF SUCH FIRST ESSAYS FULL OF THE HEAT OF YOUTH THERE IS A MISTINESS AND A CHORD VIBRATING IN THE MIST
978-132494-0033 YOUR ARTICLE IS ABSURD AND FANTASTIC BUT THERE'S A TRANSPARENT SINCERITY A YOUTHFUL INCORRUPTIBLE PRIDE AND THE DARING OF DESPAIR IN IT IT'S A GLOOMY ARTICLE BUT THAT'S WHAT'S FINE IN IT
978-132494-0034 I READ YOUR ARTICLE AND PUT IT ASIDE THINKING AS I DID SO THAT MAN WON'T GO THE COMMON WAY WELL I ASK YOU
978-132494-0035 HOW COULD I HELP BEING CARRIED AWAY BY WHAT FOLLOWED
978-132494-0036 WHAT IS THERE IN IT I REFLECTED THERE'S NOTHING IN IT THAT IS REALLY NOTHING AND PERHAPS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND IT'S NOT AT ALL THE THING FOR THE PROSECUTOR TO LET HIMSELF BE CARRIED AWAY BY NOTIONS
978-132494-0037 HERE I HAVE NIKOLAY ON MY HANDS WITH ACTUAL EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM YOU MAY THINK WHAT YOU LIKE OF IT BUT IT'S EVIDENCE HE BRINGS IN HIS PSYCHOLOGY TOO ONE HAS TO CONSIDER HIM TOO FOR IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH WHY AM I EXPLAINING THIS TO YOU
978-132494-0038 THAT YOU MAY UNDERSTAND AND NOT BLAME MY MALICIOUS BEHAVIOUR ON THAT OCCASION
978-132494-0039 WAS HERE WHEN YOU WERE LYING ILL IN BED NOT OFFICIALLY NOT IN MY OWN PERSON BUT I WAS HERE
978-132494-0040 UMSONST I THOUGHT TO MYSELF NOW THAT MAN WILL COME WILL COME OF HIMSELF AND QUICKLY TOO
978-132494-0041 ANOTHER MAN WOULDN'T BUT HE WILL AND YOU REMEMBER HOW MISTER RAZUMIHIN BEGAN DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT WITH YOU
978-132494-0042 AND RAZUMIHIN IS NOT A MAN TO RESTRAIN HIS INDIGNATION MISTER ZAMETOV WAS TREMENDOUSLY STRUCK BY YOUR ANGER AND YOUR OPEN DARING THINK OF BLURTING OUT IN A RESTAURANT
978-132494-0043 THAT WAS WHAT I THOUGHT AT THE TIME I WAS EXPECTING YOU BUT YOU SIMPLY BOWLED ZAMETOV OVER AND WELL YOU SEE IT ALL LIES IN THIS THAT THIS DAMNABLE PSYCHOLOGY CAN BE TAKEN TWO WAYS
978-132494-0044 MY HEART WAS FAIRLY THROBBING ACH NOW WHY NEED YOU HAVE COME
978-132494-0045 I SAW IT ALL PLAIN AS DAYLIGHT BUT IF I HADN'T EXPECTED YOU SO SPECIALLY I SHOULD NOT HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING IN YOUR LAUGHTER YOU SEE WHAT INFLUENCE A MOOD HAS MISTER RAZUMIHIN THEN AH THAT STONE THAT STONE UNDER WHICH THE THINGS WERE HIDDEN
978-132494-0046 I SEEM TO SEE IT SOMEWHERE IN A KITCHEN GARDEN IT WAS IN A KITCHEN GARDEN YOU TOLD ZAMETOV AND AFTERWARDS YOU REPEATED THAT IN MY OFFICE AND WHEN WE BEGAN PICKING YOUR ARTICLE TO PIECES HOW YOU EXPLAINED IT
978-132494-0047 ONE COULD TAKE EVERY WORD OF YOURS IN TWO SENSES AS THOUGH THERE WERE ANOTHER MEANING HIDDEN SO IN THIS WAY RODION ROMANOVITCH I REACHED THE FURTHEST LIMIT AND KNOCKING MY HEAD AGAINST A POST I PULLED MYSELF UP ASKING MYSELF WHAT I WAS ABOUT AFTER ALL I SAID
978-132494-0048 YOU CAN TAKE IT ALL IN ANOTHER SENSE IF YOU LIKE AND IT'S MORE NATURAL SO INDEED I COULDN'T HELP ADMITTING IT WAS MORE NATURAL I WAS BOTHERED NO I'D BETTER GET HOLD OF SOME LITTLE FACT I SAID
