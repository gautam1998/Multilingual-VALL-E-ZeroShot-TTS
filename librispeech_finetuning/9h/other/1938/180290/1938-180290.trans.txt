1938-180290-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT HOWEVER CONTINUED ARMAND AFTER A PAUSE WHILE I KNEW MYSELF TO BE STILL IN LOVE WITH HER I FELT MORE SURE OF MYSELF AND PART OF MY DESIRE TO SPEAK TO MARGUERITE AGAIN
1938-180290-0001 WAS A WISH TO MAKE HER SEE THAT I WAS STRONGER THAN SHE HOW MANY WAYS DOES THE HEART TAKE HOW MANY REASONS DOES IT INVENT FOR ITSELF IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT WHAT IT WANTS
1938-180290-0002 I COULD NOT REMAIN IN THE CORRIDOR AND I RETURNED TO MY PLACE IN THE STALLS LOOKING HASTILY AROUND TO SEE WHAT BOX SHE WAS IN SHE WAS IN A GROUND FLOOR BOX QUITE ALONE SHE HAD CHANGED AS I HAVE TOLD YOU
1938-180290-0003 AND NO LONGER WORE AN INDIFFERENT SMILE ON HER LIPS SHE HAD SUFFERED SHE WAS STILL SUFFERING THOUGH IT WAS APRIL SHE WAS STILL WEARING A WINTER COSTUME ALL WRAPPED UP IN FURS
1938-180290-0004 I GAZED AT HER SO FIXEDLY THAT MY EYES ATTRACTED HERS SHE LOOKED AT ME FOR A FEW SECONDS PUT UP HER OPERA GLASS TO SEE ME BETTER AND SEEMED TO THINK SHE RECOGNISED ME WITHOUT BEING QUITE SURE WHO I WAS
1938-180290-0005 FOR WHEN SHE PUT DOWN HER GLASSES A SMILE THAT CHARMING FEMININE SALUTATION FLITTED ACROSS HER LIPS AS IF TO ANSWER THE BOW WHICH SHE SEEMED TO EXPECT BUT I DID NOT RESPOND
1938-180290-0006 SO AS TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER HER AS IF I HAD FORGOTTEN WHILE SHE REMEMBERED SUPPOSING HERSELF MISTAKEN SHE LOOKED AWAY THE CURTAIN WENT UP I HAVE OFTEN SEEN MARGUERITE AT THE THEATRE
1938-180290-0007 I NEVER SAW HER PAY THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS BEING ACTED AS FOR ME THE PERFORMANCE INTERESTED ME EQUALLY LITTLE AND I PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING BUT HER THOUGH DOING MY UTMOST TO KEEP HER FROM NOTICING IT
1938-180290-0008 PRESENTLY I SAW HER GLANCING ACROSS AT THE PERSON WHO WAS IN THE OPPOSITE BOX ON LOOKING I SAW A WOMAN WITH WHOM I WAS QUITE FAMILIAR SHE HAD ONCE BEEN A KEPT WOMAN AND HAD TRIED TO GO ON THE STAGE HAD FAILED
1938-180290-0009 AND RELYING ON HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH FASHIONABLE PEOPLE IN PARIS HAD GONE INTO BUSINESS AND TAKEN A MILLINER'S SHOP I SAW IN HER A MEANS OF MEETING WITH MARGUERITE
1938-180290-0010 AND PROFITED BY A MOMENT IN WHICH SHE LOOKED MY WAY TO WAVE MY HAND TO HER AS I EXPECTED SHE BECKONED TO ME TO COME TO HER BOX PRUDENCE DUVERNOY THAT WAS THE MILLINER'S AUSPICIOUS NAME
1938-180290-0011 WAS ONE OF THOSE FAT WOMEN OF FORTY WITH WHOM ONE REQUIRES VERY LITTLE DIPLOMACY TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT ONE WANTS TO KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN WHAT ONE WANTS TO KNOW IS AS SIMPLE AS WHAT I HAD TO ASK OF HER
1938-180290-0012 I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS SMILING ACROSS AT MARGUERITE TO ASK HER WHOM ARE YOU LOOKING AT MARGUERITE GAUTIER YOU KNOW HER YES I AM HER MILLINER AND SHE IS A NEIGHBOUR OF MINE
1938-180290-0013 THE WINDOW OF HER DRESSING ROOM LOOKS ON TO THE WINDOW OF MINE THEY SAY SHE IS A CHARMING GIRL DON'T YOU KNOW HER NO BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SHALL I ASK HER TO COME OVER TO OUR BOX NO
1938-180290-0014 I WOULD RATHER FOR YOU TO INTRODUCE ME TO HER AT HER OWN HOUSE YES THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT WHY BECAUSE SHE IS UNDER THE PROTECTION OF A JEALOUS OLD DUKE PROTECTION IS CHARMING
1938-180290-0015 YES PROTECTION REPLIED PRUDENCE POOR OLD MAN HE WOULD BE GREATLY EMBARRASSED TO OFFER HER ANYTHING ELSE PRUDENCE THEN TOLD ME HOW MARGUERITE HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE DUKE AT BAGNERES
1938-180290-0016 THAT THEN I CONTINUED IS WHY SHE IS ALONE HERE PRECISELY BUT WHO WILL SEE HER HOME HE WILL
1938-180290-0017 AND YOU WHO IS SEEING YOU HOME NO ONE MAY I OFFER MYSELF BUT YOU ARE WITH A FRIEND ARE YOU NOT
1938-180290-0018 WHO IS YOUR FRIEND A CHARMING FELLOW VERY AMUSING HE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WELL ALL RIGHT WE WILL GO AFTER THIS PIECE IS OVER FOR I KNOW THE LAST PIECE WITH PLEASURE
1938-180290-0019 I WILL GO AND TELL MY FRIEND GO THEN AH ADDED PRUDENCE AS I WAS GOING THERE IS THE DUKE JUST COMING INTO MARGUERITE'S BOX I LOOKED AT HIM A MAN OF ABOUT SEVENTY HAD SAT DOWN BEHIND HER
1938-180290-0020 AND WAS GIVING HER A BAG OF SWEETS INTO WHICH SHE DIPPED AT ONCE SMILING THEN SHE HELD IT OUT TOWARD PRUDENCE WITH A GESTURE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY WILL YOU HAVE SOME NO SIGNALLED PRUDENCE
1938-180290-0021 MARGUERITE DREW BACK THE BAG AND TURNING BEGAN TO TALK WITH THE DUKE IT MAY SOUND CHILDISH TO TELL YOU ALL THESE DETAILS BUT EVERYTHING RELATING TO MARGUERITE IS SO FRESH IN MY MEMORY THAT I CAN NOT HELP RECALLING THEM NOW
1938-180290-0022 I WENT BACK TO GASTON AND TOLD HIM OF THE ARRANGEMENT I HAD MADE FOR HIM AND FOR ME HE AGREED
1938-180290-0023 WE HAD SCARCELY OPENED THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE STALLS WHEN WE HAD TO STAND ASIDE TO ALLOW MARGUERITE AND THE DUKE TO PASS I WOULD HAVE GIVEN TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE TO HAVE BEEN IN THE OLD MAN'S PLACE
1938-180290-0024 WHEN THEY WERE ON THE STREET HE HANDED HER INTO A PHAETON WHICH HE DROVE HIMSELF AND THEY WERE WHIRLED AWAY BY TWO SUPERB HORSES WE RETURNED TO PRUDENCE'S BOX AND WHEN THE PLAY WAS OVER
1938-180290-0025 AT THE DOOR PRUDENCE ASKED US TO COME UP AND SEE HER SHOWROOMS WHICH WE HAD NEVER SEEN AND OF WHICH SHE SEEMED VERY PROUD YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EAGERLY I ACCEPTED IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF I WAS COMING NEARER AND NEARER TO MARGUERITE
1938-180290-0026 I SOON TURNED THE CONVERSATION IN HER DIRECTION THE OLD DUKE IS AT YOUR NEIGHBOURS I SAID TO PRUDENCE OH NO SHE IS PROBABLY ALONE BUT SHE MUST BE DREADFULLY BORED SAID GASTON
1938-180290-0027 WE SPEND MOST OF OUR EVENING TOGETHER OR SHE CALLS TO ME WHEN SHE COMES IN SHE NEVER GOES TO BED BEFORE TWO IN THE MORNING SHE CAN'T SLEEP BEFORE THAT WHY BECAUSE SHE SUFFERS IN THE CHEST AND IS ALMOST ALWAYS FEVERISH
1938-180290-0028 HASN'T SHE ANY LOVERS I ASKED I NEVER SEE ANY ONE REMAIN AFTER I LEAVE I DON'T SAY NO ONE EVER COMES WHEN I AM GONE OFTEN IN THE EVENING I MEET THERE A CERTAIN COMTE DE N
1938-180290-0029 WHO THINKS HE IS MAKING SOME HEADWAY BY CALLING ON HER AT ELEVEN IN THE EVENING AND BY SENDING HER JEWELS TO ANY EXTENT BUT SHE CAN'T STAND HIM SHE MAKES A MISTAKE HE IS VERY RICH IT IS IN VAIN THAT I SAY TO HER FROM TIME TO TIME
1938-180290-0030 MY DEAR CHILD THERE'S THE MAN FOR YOU SHE WHO GENERALLY LISTENS TO ME TURNS HER BACK AND REPLIES THAT HE IS TOO STUPID STUPID INDEED HE IS BUT IT WOULD BE A POSITION FOR HER
1938-180290-0031 WHILE THIS OLD DUKE MIGHT DIE ANY DAY OLD MEN ARE EGOISTS HIS FAMILY ARE ALWAYS REPROACHING HIM FOR HIS AFFECTION FOR MARGUERITE THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY HE IS LIKELY TO LEAVE HER NOTHING I GIVE HER GOOD ADVICE
1938-180290-0032 AND SHE ONLY SAYS IT WILL BE PLENTY OF TIME TO TAKE ON THE COUNT WHEN THE DUKE IS DEAD IT ISN'T ALL FUN CONTINUED PRUDENCE TO LIVE LIKE THAT I KNOW VERY WELL IT WOULDN'T SUIT ME AND I SHOULD SOON SEND THE OLD MAN ABOUT HIS BUSINESS HE IS SO DULL
1938-180290-0033 HE CALLS HER HIS DAUGHTER LOOKS AFTER HER LIKE A CHILD AND IS ALWAYS IN THE WAY I AM SURE AT THIS VERY MOMENT ONE OF HIS SERVANTS IS PROWLING ABOUT IN THE STREET TO SEE WHO COMES OUT AND ESPECIALLY WHO GOES IN AH
1938-180290-0034 POOR MARGUERITE SAID GASTON SITTING DOWN TO THE PIANO AND PLAYING A WALTZ I HADN'T A NOTION OF IT BUT I DID NOTICE SHE HASN'T BEEN LOOKING SO GAY LATELY HUSH SAID PRUDENCE LISTENING GASTON STOPPED
1938-180290-0035 SHE IS CALLING ME I THINK WE LISTENED A VOICE WAS CALLING PRUDENCE COME NOW YOU MUST GO
1938-180290-0036 AH THAT IS YOUR IDEA OF HOSPITALITY SAID GASTON LAUGHING WE WON'T GO TILL WE PLEASE WHY SHOULD WE GO I AM GOING OVER TO MARGUERITE'S WE WILL WAIT HERE YOU CAN'T
1938-180290-0037 THEN WE WILL GO WITH YOU THAT STILL LESS I KNOW MARGUERITE SAID GASTON I CAN VERY WELL PAY HER A CALL BUT ARMAND DOESN'T KNOW HER I WILL INTRODUCE HIM IMPOSSIBLE
1938-180290-0038 WE AGAIN HEARD MARGUERITE'S VOICE CALLING TO PRUDENCE WHO RUSHED TO HER DRESSING ROOM WINDOW I FOLLOWED WITH GASTON AS SHE OPENED THE WINDOW WE HID OURSELVES SO AS NOT TO BE SEEN FROM OUTSIDE
1938-180290-0039 I HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU FOR TEN MINUTES SAID MARGUERITE FROM HER WINDOW IN ALMOST AN IMPERIOUS TONE OF VOICE WHAT DO YOU WANT I WANT YOU TO COME OVER AT ONCE WHY
1938-180290-0040 BECAUSE THE COMTE DE N IS STILL HERE AND HE IS BORING ME TO DEATH I CAN'T NOW WHAT IS HINDERING YOU THERE ARE TWO YOUNG FELLOWS HERE WHO WON'T GO

1938-180290-0044 WHO HAD REMEMBERED MY FACE FOR A MOMENT DID NOT REMEMBER MY NAME I WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED TO MY DISADVANTAGE THAN THUS FORGOTTEN I KNEW SAID GASTON THAT SHE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEE US
1938-180290-0045 DELIGHTED ISN'T THE WORD
1938-180290-0046 TRY TO BE MORE AGREEABLE THAN HE IS OR I KNOW MARGUERITE SHE WILL PUT IT ALL DOWN TO ME WE FOLLOWED PRUDENCE DOWNSTAIRS I TREMBLED IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THIS VISIT WAS TO HAVE A GREAT INFLUENCE ON MY LIFE
1938-180290-0047 I WAS STILL MORE AGITATED THAN ON THE EVENING WHEN I WAS INTRODUCED IN THE BOX AT THE OPERA COMIQUE AS WE REACHED THE DOOR THAT YOU KNOW MY HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT I WAS HARDLY ABLE TO THINK WE HEARD THE SOUND OF A PIANO
1938-180290-0048 PRUDENCE RANG THE PIANO WAS SILENT A WOMAN WHO LOOKED MORE LIKE A COMPANION THAN A SERVANT OPENED THE DOOR WE WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND FROM THAT TO THE BOUDOIR WHICH WAS THEN JUST AS YOU HAVE SEEN IT SINCE
1938-180290-0049 A YOUNG MAN WAS LEANING AGAINST THE MANTEL PIECE MARGUERITE SEATED AT THE PIANO LET HER FINGERS WANDER OVER THE NOTES BEGINNING SCRAPS OF MUSIC WITHOUT FINISHING THEM THE WHOLE SCENE BREATHED BOREDOM
1938-180290-0050 THE MAN EMBARRASSED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS NULLITY THE WOMAN TIRED OF HER DISMAL VISITOR
