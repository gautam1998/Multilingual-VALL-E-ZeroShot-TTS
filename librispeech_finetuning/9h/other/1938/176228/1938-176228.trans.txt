1938-176228-0011 HE LOOKED AT ME WITH HIS UNPITYING UNBLINKING GLANCE SO THROUGH THE WINDOW AGAIN LIKE A THIEF IS IT ALWAYS THROUGH THAT DOOR THAT YOU COME INTO A HOUSE HE PAUSED
1938-176228-0012 AS IF TO GIVE ME TIME TO DIGEST HIS GIBE YOU SAW PAUL LESSINGHAM WELL THE GREAT PAUL LESSINGHAM WAS HE THEN SO GREAT
1938-176228-0013 REMINDED ME IN SOME UNCOMFORTABLE WAY OF A RUSTY SAW THE THINGS HE SAID AND THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SAID THEM WERE ALIKE INTENDED TO ADD TO MY DISCOMFORT IT WAS SOLELY BECAUSE THE FEAT WAS BARELY POSSIBLE
1938-176228-0014 THAT HE ONLY PARTIALLY SUCCEEDED LIKE A THIEF YOU WENT INTO HIS HOUSE DID I NOT TELL YOU THAT YOU WOULD LIKE A THIEF HE FOUND YOU WERE YOU NOT ASHAMED SINCE LIKE A THIEF HE FOUND YOU HOW COMES IT THAT YOU HAVE ESCAPED
1938-176228-0015 BY WHAT ROBBER'S ARTIFICE HAVE YOU SAVED YOURSELF FROM G A O L HIS MANNER CHANGED SO THAT ALL AT ONCE HE SEEMED TO SNARL AT ME
1938-176228-0016 YOU ARE SMALL BUT HE IS SMALLER YOUR GREAT PAUL LESSINGHAM
1938-176228-0017 I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT THERE MIGHT BE A MODICUM OF TRUTH IN WHAT WITH SUCH AN INTENSITY OF BITTERNESS THE SPEAKER SUGGESTED THE PICTURE WHICH IN MY MENTAL GALLERY I HAD HUNG IN THE PLACE OF HONOUR SEEMED TO SAY THE LEAST
1938-176228-0018 TO HAVE BECOME A TRIFLE SMUDGED AS USUAL THE MAN IN THE BED SEEMED TO EXPERIENCE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFICULTY IN DECIPHERING WHAT WAS PASSING THROUGH MY MIND THAT IS SO YOU AND HE YOU ARE A PAIR
1938-176228-0019 THE GREAT PAUL LESSINGHAM IS AS GREAT A THIEF AS YOU AND GREATER FOR AT LEAST THAN YOU HE HAS MORE COURAGE FOR SOME MOMENTS HE WAS STILL THEN EXCLAIMED WITH SUDDEN FIERCENESS
1938-176228-0020 GIVE ME WHAT YOU HAVE STOLEN I MOVED TOWARDS THE BED MOST UNWILLINGLY AND HELD OUT TO HIM THE PACKET OF LETTERS WHICH I HAD ABSTRACTED FROM THE LITTLE DRAWER PERCEIVING MY DISINCLINATION TO HIS NEAR NEIGHBOURHOOD
1938-176228-0021 HE SET HIMSELF TO PLAY WITH IT IGNORING MY OUTSTRETCHED HAND HE STARED ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE WHAT AILS YOU
1938-176228-0022 IS IT NOT SWEET TO STAND CLOSE AT MY SIDE YOU WITH YOUR WHITE SKIN IF I WERE A WOMAN WOULD YOU NOT TAKE ME FOR A WIFE THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS WAS SAID WHICH WAS SO ESSENTIALLY FEMININE
1938-176228-0023 THAT ONCE MORE I WONDERED IF I COULD POSSIBLY BE MISTAKEN IN THE CREATURE'S SEX I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STRIKE HIM ACROSS THE FACE OR BETTER TO HAVE TAKEN HIM BY THE NECK AND THROWN HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW AND ROLLED HIM IN THE MUD
1938-176228-0024 HE CONDESCENDED TO NOTICE WHAT I WAS HOLDING OUT TO HIM SO THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE STOLEN THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TAKEN FROM THE DRAWER IN THE BUREAU THE DRAWER WHICH WAS LOCKED
1938-176228-0025 AND WHICH YOU USED THE ARTS IN WHICH A THIEF IS SKILLED TO ENTER GIVE IT TO ME THIEF HE SNATCHED THE PACKET FROM ME SCRATCHING THE BACK OF MY HAND AS HE DID SO AS IF HIS NAILS HAD BEEN TALONS
1938-176228-0026 HE TURNED THE PACKET OVER AND OVER GLARING AT IT AS HE DID SO IT WAS STRANGE WHAT A RELIEF IT WAS TO HAVE HIS GLANCE REMOVED FROM OFF MY FACE YOU KEPT IT IN YOUR INNER DRAWER PAUL LESSINGHAM
1938-176228-0027 YOU HID IT AS ONE HIDES TREASURE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING HERE WORTH HAVING WORTH SEEING WORTH KNOWING YES WORTH KNOWING SINCE YOU FOUND IT WORTH YOUR WHILE TO HIDE IT UP SO CLOSELY AS I HAVE SAID
1938-176228-0028 THE PACKET WAS BOUND ABOUT BY A STRING OF PINK RIBBON A FACT ON WHICH HE PRESENTLY BEGAN TO COMMENT WITH WHAT A PRETTY STRING YOU HAVE ENCIRCLED IT AND HOW NEATLY IT IS TIED SURELY ONLY A WOMAN'S HAND COULD TIE A KNOT LIKE THAT
1938-176228-0029 WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED YOURS WERE SUCH AGILE FINGERS SO AN ENDORSEMENT ON THE COVER WHAT'S THIS LET'S SEE WHAT'S WRITTEN THE LETTERS OF MY DEAR LOVE MARJORIE LINDON
1938-176228-0030 AS HE READ THESE WORDS WHICH AS HE SAID WERE ENDORSED UPON THE OUTER SHEET OF PAPER WHICH SERVED AS A COVER FOR THE LETTERS WHICH WERE ENCLOSED WITHIN HIS FACE BECAME TRANSFIGURED NEVER DID I SUPPOSE THAT RAGE COULD HAVE SO POSSESSED A HUMAN COUNTENANCE
1938-176228-0031 HIS JAW DROPPED OPEN SO THAT HIS YELLOW FANGS GLEAMED THOUGH HIS PARTED LIPS HE HELD HIS BREATH SO LONG THAT EACH MOMENT I LOOKED TO SEE HIM FALL DOWN IN A FIT THE VEINS STOOD OUT ALL OVER HIS FACE AND HEAD LIKE SEAMS OF BLOOD
1938-176228-0032 I KNOW NOT HOW LONG HE CONTINUED SPEECHLESS WHEN HIS BREATH RETURNED IT WAS WITH CHOKINGS AND GASPINGS IN THE MIDST OF WHICH HE HISSED OUT HIS WORDS AS IF THEIR MERE PASSAGE THROUGH HIS THROAT BROUGHT HIM NEAR TO STRANGULATION
1938-176228-0033 THE LETTERS OF HIS DEAR LOVE OF HIS DEAR LOVE HIS PAUL LESSINGHAM'S SO IT IS AS I GUESSED AS I KNEW AS I SAW MARJORIE LINDON
1938-176228-0034 SWEET MARJORIE HIS DEAR LOVE PAUL LESSINGHAM'S DEAR LOVE SHE WITH THE LILY FACE THE CORN HUED HAIR WHAT IS IT HIS DEAR LOVE HAS FOUND IN HER FOND HEART TO WRITE PAUL LESSINGHAM
1938-176228-0035 SITTING UP IN BED HE TORE THE PACKET OPEN IT CONTAINED PERHAPS EIGHT OR NINE LETTERS SOME MERE NOTES SOME LONG EPISTLES BUT SHORT OR LONG
1938-176228-0036 HE DEVOURED THEM WITH EQUAL APPETITE EACH ONE OVER AND OVER AGAIN TILL I THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE RE READING THEM THEY WERE ON THICK WHITE PAPER OF A PECULIAR SHADE OF WHITENESS WITH UNTRIMMED EDGES
1938-176228-0037 ON EACH SHEET A CREST AND AN ADDRESS WERE STAMPED IN GOLD AND ALL THE SHEETS WERE OF THE SAME SHAPE AND SIZE I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF ANYWHERE AT ANY TIME I SAW WRITING PAPER LIKE THAT AGAIN
1938-176228-0038 I SHOULD NOT FAIL TO KNOW IT THE CALIGRAPHY WAS LIKE THE PAPER UNUSUAL BOLD DECIDED AND I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED PRODUCED BY A J PEN ALL THE TIME THAT HE WAS READING
1938-176228-0039 HE KEPT EMITTING SOUNDS MORE RESEMBLING YELPS AND SNARLS THAN ANYTHING MORE HUMAN LIKE SOME SAVAGE BEAST NURSING ITS PENT UP RAGE WHEN HE HAD MADE AN END OF READING FOR THE SEASON HE LET HIS PASSION HAVE FULL VENT
1938-176228-0040 SO THAT IS WHAT HIS DEAR LOVE HAS FOUND IT IN HER HEART TO WRITE PAUL LESSINGHAM PAUL LESSINGHAM PEN CANNOT DESCRIBE THE CONCENTRATED FRENZY OF HATRED WITH WHICH THE SPEAKER DWELT UPON THE NAME
1938-176228-0041 HE SHALL BE GROUND BETWEEN THE UPPER AND THE NETHER STONES IN THE TOWERS OF ANGUISH
1938-176228-0042 TO STINK UNDER THE BLOOD GRIMED SUN
1938-176228-0043 FOR MARJORIE LINDON FOR HIS DEAR LOVE IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT SHE SHALL WISH THAT SHE WAS NEVER BORN NOR HE AND THE GODS OF THE SHADOWS SHALL SMELL THE SWEET INCENSE OF HER SUFFERING
1938-176228-0044 IT SHALL BE IT SHALL BE IT IS I THAT SAY IT EVEN I IN THE MADNESS OF HIS RHAPSODICAL FRENZY I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY FORGOTTEN I WAS THERE BUT ON A SUDDEN GLANCING ASIDE
1938-176228-0045 HE SAW ME AND REMEMBERED AND WAS PROMPT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO WREAK HIS RAGE UPON A TANGIBLE OBJECT IT IS YOU YOU THIEF YOU STILL LIVE TO MAKE A MOCK OF ONE OF THE CHILDREN OF THE GODS
1938-176228-0046 HE LEAPED SHRIEKING OFF THE BED AND SPRANG AT ME CLASPING MY THROAT WITH HIS HORRID HANDS BEARING ME BACKWARDS ON TO THE FLOOR I FELT HIS BREATH MINGLE WITH MINE
