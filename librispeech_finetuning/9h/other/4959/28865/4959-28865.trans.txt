4959-28865-0011 I DID HEAR THAT THE HORSE IN WHICH YOU ARE BOTH INTERESTED HAD FAILED TO WIN THE RACE YES HE DID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CALL HIM YOUR GRACE
4959-28865-0012 OUT OF COMPLIMENT TO A CERTAIN MINISTRY WHICH I WISH IT WAS GOING ON TO DAY INSTEAD OF THE SEEDY LOT WE'VE GOT IN I THINK MY LORD DUKE THAT ANY ONE YOU MAY ASK WILL TELL YOU THAT I KNOW WHAT RUNNING IS WELL I CAN ASSURE YOU
4959-28865-0013 YOUR GRACE THAT IS THAT SINCE I'VE SEEN ORSES I'VE NEVER SEEN A ORSE FITTER THAN HIM WHEN HE GOT HIS CANTER THAT MORNING IT WAS NEARLY EVEN BETTING NOT THAT I OR SILVERBRIDGE WERE FOOLS ENOUGH TO PUT ON ANYTHING AT THAT RATE
4959-28865-0014 BUT I NEVER SAW A ORSE SO BAD RIDDEN I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING MY LORD DUKE AGAINST THE MAN BUT IF THAT FELLOW HADN'T BEEN SQUARED OR ELSE WASN'T DRUNK OR ELSE WASN'T OFF HIS HEAD THAT ORSE MUST HAVE WON MY LORD DUKE
4959-28865-0015 I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RACING MAJOR TIFTO I SUPPOSE NOT YOUR GRACE BUT AS I AND SILVERBRIDGE ARE TOGETHER IN THIS MATTER I THOUGHT I'D JUST LET YOUR GRACE KNOW THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE HAD A VERY GOOD THING
4959-28865-0016 I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS YOUR GRACE MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW THAT TIFTO YOU ARE MAKING AN ASS OF YOURSELF SAID SILVERBRIDGE MAKING AN ASS OF MYSELF EXCLAIMED THE MAJOR YES CONSIDERABLY
4959-28865-0017 I THINK YOU ARE A LITTLE HARD UPON YOUR FRIEND SAID THE DUKE WITH AN ATTEMPT AT A LAUGH
4959-28865-0018 I THOUGHT MY LORD DUKE YOU MIGHT CARE ABOUT LEARNING HOW SILVERBRIDGE WAS GOING ON THIS THE POOR LITTLE MAN SAID ALMOST WITH A WHINE HIS PARTNER'S ROUGHNESS HAD KNOCKED OUT OF HIM NEARLY ALL THE COURAGE WHICH BACCHUS HAD GIVEN HIM
4959-28865-0019 SO I DO ANYTHING THAT INTERESTS HIM INTERESTS ME BUT PERHAPS OF ALL HIS PURSUITS RACING IS THE ONE TO WHICH I AM LEAST ABLE TO LEND AN ATTENTIVE EAR THAT EVERY HORSE HAS A HEAD
4959-28865-0020 AND THAT ALL DID HAVE TAILS TILL THEY WERE ILL USED IS THE EXTENT OF MY STABLE KNOWLEDGE VERY GOOD INDEED MY LORD DUKE VERY GOOD INDEED HA HA HA ALL HORSES HAVE HEADS AND ALL HAVE TAILS HEADS AND TAILS
4959-28865-0021 UPON MY WORD THAT IS THE BEST THING I HAVE HEARD FOR A LONG TIME I WILL DO MYSELF THE HONOUR OF WISHING YOUR GRACE GOOD NIGHT BY BYE SILVERBRIDGE THEN HE LEFT THE ROOM
4959-28865-0022 HAVING BEEN MADE SUPREMELY HAPPY BY WHAT HE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN THE DUKE'S JOKE NEVERTHELESS HE WOULD REMEMBER THE SNUBBING AND WOULD BE EVEN WITH SILVERBRIDGE SOME DAY DID LORD SILVERBRIDGE THINK THAT HE WAS GOING TO LOOK AFTER HIS LORDSHIP'S ORSES
4959-28865-0023 AND DO THIS ALWAYS ON THE SQUARE AND THEN BE SNUBBED FOR DOING IT I AM VERY SORRY THAT HE SHOULD HAVE COME IN TO TROUBLE YOU SAID THE SON HE HAS NOT TROUBLED ME MUCH I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE HAS TROUBLED YOU
4959-28865-0024 IF YOU ARE COMING DOWN TO THE HOUSE AGAIN I WILL WALK WITH YOU SILVERBRIDGE OF COURSE HAD TO GO DOWN TO THE HOUSE AGAIN AND THEY STARTED TOGETHER
4959-28865-0025 THAT MAN DID NOT TROUBLE ME SILVERBRIDGE BUT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER SUCH AN ACQUAINTANCE MUST NOT BE TROUBLESOME TO YOU I'M NOT VERY PROUD OF HIM SIR BUT I THINK ONE OUGHT TO BE PROUD OF ONE'S FRIENDS HE ISN'T MY FRIEND IN THAT WAY AT ALL
4959-28865-0026 IN WHAT WAY THEN HE UNDERSTANDS RACING HE IS THE PARTNER OF YOUR PLEASURE THEN THE MAN IN WHOSE SOCIETY YOU LOVE TO ENJOY THE RECREATION OF THE RACE COURSE
4959-28865-0027 IT IS SIR BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS IT I THOUGHT THAT A GENTLEMAN ON THE TURF WOULD HAVE A TRAINER FOR THAT PURPOSE NOT A COMPANION YOU MEAN TO IMPLY THAT YOU CAN SAVE MONEY BY LEAGUING YOURSELF WITH MAJOR TIFTO NO SIR INDEED
4959-28865-0028 IF YOU ASSOCIATE WITH HIM NOT FOR PLEASURE THEN IT SURELY MUST BE FOR PROFIT THAT YOU SHOULD DO THE FORMER WOULD BE TO ME SO SURPRISING THAT I MUST REGARD IT AS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD DO THE LATTER IS I THINK A REPROACH
4959-28865-0029 THIS HE SAID WITH NO TONE OF ANGER IN HIS VOICE SO GENTLY THAT SILVERBRIDGE AT FIRST HARDLY UNDERSTOOD IT BUT GRADUALLY ALL THAT WAS MEANT CAME IN UPON HIM AND HE FELT HIMSELF TO BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
4959-28865-0030 HE IS BAD HE SAID AT LAST WHETHER HE BE BAD I WILL NOT SAY BUT I AM SURE THAT YOU CAN GAIN NOTHING BY HIS COMPANIONSHIP I WILL GET RID OF HIM SAID SILVERBRIDGE AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE
4959-28865-0031 I CANNOT DO SO AT ONCE BUT I WILL DO IT IT WILL BE BETTER I THINK TREGEAR HAS BEEN TELLING ME THE SAME THING IS HE OBJECTIONABLE TO MISTER TREGEAR ASKED THE DUKE OH YES TREGEAR CANNOT BEAR HIM
4959-28865-0032 I DO NOT DENY THAT HE IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WELL BUT SO ALSO IS YOUR GROOM LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT HIM AND SO IT IS TO BE MABEL GREX I DID NOT SAY SO SIR
4959-28865-0033 HOW CAN I ANSWER FOR HER ONLY IT WAS SO PLEASANT FOR ME TO KNOW THAT YOU WOULD APPROVE IF IT SHOULD COME OFF YES I WILL APPROVE WHEN SHE HAS ACCEPTED YOU BUT I DON'T THINK SHE WILL
4959-28865-0034 IF SHE SHOULD TELL HER THAT I WILL GO TO HER AT ONCE IT WILL BE MUCH TO HAVE A NEW DAUGHTER VERY MUCH THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A WIFE WHERE WOULD SHE LIKE TO LIVE
4959-28865-0035 I DARE SAY NOT I DARE SAY NOT SAID THE DUKE GATHERUM IS ALWAYS THOUGHT TO BE DULL
4959-28865-0036 HAVE YOU ASKED HER NO SIR BUT NOBODY EVER DID LIKE GATHERUM I SUPPOSE NOT AND YET SILVERBRIDGE WHAT A SUM OF MONEY IT COST I BELIEVE IT DID
4959-28865-0037 ALL VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT THE DUKE NO DOUBT WAS THINKING OF CERTAIN SCENES PASSED AT THE GREAT HOUSE IN QUESTION WHICH SCENES HAD NOT BEEN DELIGHTFUL TO HIM NO I DON'T SUPPOSE SHE WOULD WISH TO LIVE AT GATHERUM
4959-28865-0038 THE HORNS WAS GIVEN EXPRESSLY BY MY UNCLE TO YOUR DEAR MOTHER AND I SHOULD LIKE MARY TO HAVE THE PLACE CERTAINLY YOU SHOULD LIVE AMONG YOUR TENANTRY I DON'T CARE SO VERY MUCH FOR MATCHING
4959-28865-0039 IT IS THE ONE PLACE YOU DO LIKE SIR HOWEVER WE CAN MANAGE ALL THAT CARLTON TERRACE I DO NOT PARTICULARLY LIKE BUT IT IS A GOOD HOUSE
4959-28865-0040 WHEN IT IS SETTLED LET ME KNOW AT ONCE BUT IF IT SHOULD NEVER BE SETTLED I WILL ASK NO QUESTIONS BUT IF IT BE SETTLED TELL ME THEN IN PALACE YARD HE WAS TURNING TO GO
4959-28865-0041 BUT BEFORE HE DID SO HE SAID ANOTHER WORD LEANING ON HIS SON'S SHOULDER I DO NOT THINK THAT MABEL GREX AND MAJOR TIFTO WOULD DO WELL TOGETHER AT ALL THERE SHALL BE AN END TO THAT SIR GOD BLESS YOU MY BOY SAID THE DUKE
4959-28865-0042 LORD SILVERBRIDGE SAT IN THE HOUSE OR TO SPEAK MORE ACCURATELY IN THE SMOKING ROOM OF THE HOUSE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THINKING OVER ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS FATHER
4959-28865-0043 BUT ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT IT HAD ALL COME OUT NOW AT ANY RATE IT WAS DECIDED FOR HIM THAT HE MUST IN SET TERMS ASK HER TO BE HIS WIFE THE SCENE WHICH HAD JUST OCCURRED HAD MADE HIM THOROUGHLY SICK OF MAJOR TIFTO
4959-28865-0044 HE MUST GET RID OF THE MAJOR AND THERE COULD BE NO WAY OF DOING THIS AT ONCE SO EASY AND SO LITTLE OPEN TO OBSERVATION AS MARRIAGE IF HE WERE BUT ONCE ENGAGED TO MABEL GREX THE DISMISSAL OF TIFTO WOULD BE QUITE A MATTER OF COURSE
