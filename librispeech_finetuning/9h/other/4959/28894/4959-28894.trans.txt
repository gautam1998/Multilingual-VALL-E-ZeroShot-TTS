4959-28894-0000 THERE WERE NINE DAYS OF THIS WORK DURING WHICH LORD SILVERBRIDGE BECAME VERY POPULAR AND MADE MANY SPEECHES TREGEAR DID NOT WIN HALF SO MANY HEARTS OR RECOMMEND HIMSELF SO THOROUGHLY TO THE POLITICAL PREDILECTIONS OF THE BOROUGH
4959-28894-0001 BUT NEVERTHELESS HE WAS RETURNED IT WOULD PROBABLY BE UNJUST TO ATTRIBUTE THIS SUCCESS CHIEFLY TO THE YOUNG LORD'S ELOQUENCE IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT DUE TO THE STRONG RELIGIOUS FEELINGS OF THE RECTOR
4959-28894-0002 IT IS TO BE FEARED THAT EVEN THE THOUGHTFUL POLITICAL CONVICTIONS OF THE CANDIDATE DID NOT ALTOGETHER PRODUCE THE RESULT IT WAS THAT CHIEF MAN AMONG THE CANDIDATE'S GUIDES AND FRIENDS THAT LEADING PHILOSOPHER
4959-28894-0003 WHO WOULD NOT ALLOW ANYBODY TO GO HOME FROM THE RAIN AND WHO KEPT HIS EYES SO SHARPLY OPEN TO THE PECUNIARY DOINGS OF THE CARBOTTLEITES THAT MISTER CARBOTTLE'S GUIDES AND FRIENDS HAD HARDLY DARED TO SPEND A SHILLING
4959-28894-0004 IT WAS HE WHO HAD IN TRUTH BEEN EFFICACIOUS IN EVERY ATTEMPT THEY HAD MADE TO SPEND THEIR MONEY THEY HAD BEEN LOOKED INTO AND CIRCUMVENTED AS MISTER CARBOTTLE HAD BEEN BROUGHT DOWN TO POLPENNO ON PURPOSE THAT HE MIGHT SPEND MONEY
4959-28894-0005 AS HE HAD NOTHING BUT HIS MONEY TO RECOMMEND HIM AND AS HE HAD NOT SPENT IT THE FREE AND INDEPENDENT ELECTORS OF THE BOROUGH HAD NOT SEEN THEIR WAY TO VOTE FOR HIM THEREFORE THE CONSERVATIVES WERE VERY ELATE WITH THEIR TRIUMPH
4959-28894-0006 THERE WAS A GREAT CONSERVATIVE REACTION BUT THE ELECTIONEERING GUIDE PHILOSOPHER AND FRIEND IN THE HUMBLE RETIREMENT OF HIS OWN HOME HE WAS A TAILOR IN THE TOWN
4959-28894-0007 WHOSE ASSISTANCE AT SUCH PERIODS HAD LONG BEEN IN REQUISITION HE KNEW VERY WELL HOW THE SEAT HAD BEEN SECURED TEN SHILLINGS A HEAD WOULD HAVE SENT THREE HUNDRED TRUE LIBERALS TO THE BALLOT BOXES
4959-28894-0008 THE MODE OF DISTRIBUTING THE MONEY HAD BEEN ARRANGED BUT THE CONSERVATIVE TAILOR HAD BEEN TOO ACUTE AND NOT HALF A SOVEREIGN COULD BE PASSED THE TAILOR GOT TWENTY FIVE POUNDS FOR HIS WORK AND THAT WAS SMUGGLED IN AMONG THE BILLS FOR PRINTING
4959-28894-0009 MISTER WILLIAMS HOWEVER WAS SURE THAT HE HAD SO OPENED OUT THE INIQUITIES OF THE DISSENTERS AS TO HAVE CONVINCED THE BOROUGH YES EVERY SALEM AND ZION AND EBENEZER IN HIS LARGE PARISH WOULD BE CLOSED
4959-28894-0010 IT IS A GREAT THING FOR THE COUNTRY SAID MISTER WILLIAMS HE'LL MAKE A CAPITAL MEMBER SAID SILVERBRIDGE CLAPPING HIS FRIEND ON THE BACK I HOPE HE'LL NEVER FORGET SAID MISTER WILLIAMS
4959-28894-0011 OF THIS BOROUGH WHOM SHOULD THEY ELECT BUT A TREGEAR SAID THE MOTHER FEELING THAT HER RECTOR TOOK TOO MUCH OF THE PRAISE TO HIMSELF I THINK YOU HAVE DONE MORE FOR US THAN ANY ONE ELSE WHISPERED MISS TREGEAR TO THE YOUNG LORD
4959-28894-0012 WHAT YOU SAID WAS SO REASSURING THE FATHER BEFORE HE WENT TO BED EXPRESSED TO HIS SON WITH SOME TREPIDATION A HOPE THAT ALL THIS WOULD LEAD TO NO GREAT PERMANENT INCREASE OF EXPENDITURE
4959-28894-0013 THAT EVENING BEFORE HE WENT TO BED LORD SILVERBRIDGE WROTE TO HIS FATHER AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AT POLPENNO POLWENNING FIFTEENTH DECEMBER MY DEAR FATHER
4959-28894-0014 AMONG US ALL WE HAVE MANAGED TO RETURN TREGEAR I AM AFRAID YOU WILL NOT BE QUITE PLEASED BECAUSE IT WILL BE A VOTE LOST TO YOUR PARTY BUT I REALLY THINK THAT HE IS JUST THE FELLOW TO BE IN PARLIAMENT
4959-28894-0015 IF HE WERE ON YOUR SIDE I'M SURE HE'S THE KIND OF MAN YOU'D LIKE TO BRING INTO OFFICE HE IS ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT THOSE SORT OF THINGS HE SAYS THAT IF THERE WERE NO CONSERVATIVES SUCH LIBERALS AS YOU AND MISTER MONK WOULD BE DESTROYED BY THE JACOBINS
4959-28894-0016 THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT WHETHER A MAN IS A CONSERVATIVE OR NOT HIMSELF I SUPPOSE THERE OUGHT TO BE CONSERVATIVES
4959-28894-0017 THE DUKE AS HE READ THIS MADE A MEMORANDUM IN HIS OWN MIND THAT HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HIS SON THAT EVERY CARRIAGE SHOULD HAVE A DRAG TO ITS WHEELS BUT THAT AN AMBITIOUS SOUL WOULD CHOOSE TO BE THE COACHMAN RATHER THAN THE DRAG
4959-28894-0018 IT WAS BEASTLY WORK THE DUKE MADE ANOTHER MEMORANDUM TO INSTRUCT HIS SON THAT NO GENTLEMAN ABOVE THE AGE OF A SCHOOLBOY SHOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO USE SUCH A WORD IN SUCH A SENSE
4959-28894-0019 WE HAD TO GO ABOUT IN THE RAIN UP TO OUR KNEES IN MUD FOR EIGHT OR NINE DAYS ALWAYS SAYING THE SAME THING AND OF COURSE ALL THAT WE SAID WAS BOSH ANOTHER MEMORANDUM OR RATHER TWO
4959-28894-0020 ONE AS TO THE SLANG AND ANOTHER AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF TEACHING SOMETHING TO THE POOR VOTERS ON SUCH OCCASIONS OUR ONLY COMFORT WAS THAT THE CARBOTTLE PEOPLE WERE QUITE AS BADLY OFF AS US
4959-28894-0021 ANOTHER MEMORANDUM AS TO THE GRAMMAR THE ABSENCE OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY DID NOT AT THE MOMENT AFFECT THE DUKE I MADE EVER SO MANY SPEECHES TILL AT LAST IT SEEMED TO BE QUITE EASY
4959-28894-0022 HERE THERE WAS A VERY GRAVE MEMORANDUM SPEECHES EASY TO YOUNG SPEAKERS ARE GENERALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO OLD LISTENERS BUT OF COURSE IT WAS ALL BOSH THIS REQUIRED NO SEPARATE MEMORANDUM
4959-28894-0023 I HAVE PROMISED TO GO UP TO TOWN WITH TREGEAR FOR A DAY OR TWO AFTER THAT I WILL STICK TO MY PURPOSE OF GOING TO MATCHING AGAIN I WILL BE THERE ABOUT THE TWENTY SECOND AND WILL THEN STAY OVER CHRISTMAS
4959-28894-0024 AFTER THAT I AM GOING INTO THE BRAKE COUNTRY FOR SOME HUNTING IT IS SUCH A SHAME TO HAVE A LOT OF HORSES AND NEVER TO RIDE THEM YOUR MOST AFFECTIONATE SON SILVERBRIDGE
4959-28894-0025 THE LAST SENTENCE GAVE RISE IN THE DUKE'S MIND TO THE NECESSITY OF A VERY ELABORATE MEMORANDUM ON THE SUBJECT OF AMUSEMENTS GENERALLY BY THE SAME POST ANOTHER LETTER WENT FROM POLPENNO TO MATCHING
4959-28894-0026 WHICH ALSO GAVE RISE TO SOME MENTAL MEMORANDA IT WAS AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR MABEL I AM A MEMBER OF THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS
4959-28894-0027 I HAVE SOMETIMES REGARDED MYSELF AS BEING ONE OF THE MOST PECULIARLY UNFORTUNATE MEN IN THE WORLD AND YET NOW I HAVE ACHIEVED THAT WHICH ALL COMMONERS IN ENGLAND THINK TO BE THE GREATEST HONOUR WITHIN THEIR REACH
4959-28894-0028 AND HAVE DONE SO AT AN AGE AT WHICH VERY FEW ACHIEVE IT BUT THE SONS OF THE WEALTHY AND THE POWERFUL I NOW COME TO MY MISFORTUNES I KNOW THAT AS A POOR MAN I OUGHT NOT TO BE A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
4959-28894-0029 I OUGHT TO BE EARNING MY BREAD AS A LAWYER OR A DOCTOR I HAVE NO BUSINESS TO BE WHAT I AM AND WHEN I AM FORTY I SHALL FIND THAT I HAVE EATEN UP ALL MY GOOD THINGS INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM TO EAT I HAVE ONE CHANCE BEFORE ME
4959-28894-0030 YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHAT THAT IS TELL HER THAT MY PRIDE IN BEING A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT IS MUCH MORE ON HER BEHALF THAN ON MY OWN THE MAN WHO DARES TO LOVE HER OUGHT AT ANY RATE TO BE SOMETHING IN THE WORLD IF IT MIGHT BE
4959-28894-0031 IF EVER IT MAY BE I SHOULD WISH TO BE SOMETHING FOR HER SAKE I AM SURE YOU WILL BE GLAD OF MY SUCCESS YOURSELF FOR MY OWN SAKE YOUR AFFECTIONATE FRIEND AND COUSIN FRANCIS TREGEAR
4959-28894-0032 THE FIRST MENTAL MEMORANDUM IN REGARD TO THIS CAME FROM THE WRITER'S ASSERTION THAT HE AT FORTY WOULD HAVE EATEN UP ALL HIS GOOD THINGS NO HE BEING A MAN MIGHT MAKE HIS WAY TO GOOD THINGS THOUGH HE WAS NOT BORN TO THEM
4959-28894-0033 HE SURELY WOULD WIN HIS GOOD THINGS FOR HIMSELF BUT WHAT GOOD THINGS WERE IN STORE FOR HER WHAT CHANCE OF SUCCESS WAS THERE FOR HER BUT THE REFLECTION
4959-28894-0034 WHICH WAS THE MOST BITTER TO HER OF ALL CAME FROM HER ASSURANCE THAT HIS LOVE FOR THAT OTHER GIRL WAS SO GENUINE EVEN WHEN HE WAS WRITING TO HER THERE WAS NO SPARK LEFT OF THE OLD ROMANCE SOME HINT OF A RECOLLECTION OF PAST FEELINGS
4959-28894-0035 SOME HALF CONCEALED REFERENCE TO THE FORMER PASSION MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO HIM SHE AS A WOMAN AS A WOMAN ALL WHOSE FORTUNE MUST DEPEND ON MARRIAGE COULD INDULGE IN NO SUCH ALLUSIONS BUT SURELY HE NEED NOT HAVE BEEN SO HARD
4959-28894-0036 BUT STILL THERE WAS ANOTHER MEMORANDUM AT THE PRESENT MOMENT SHE WOULD DO ALL THAT HE DESIRED AS FAR AS IT WAS IN HER POWER SHE WAS ANXIOUS THAT HE SHOULD MARRY LADY MARY PALLISER
4959-28894-0037 THOUGH SO ANXIOUS ALSO THAT SOMETHING OF HIS LOVE SHOULD REMAIN WITH HERSELF SHE WAS QUITE WILLING TO CONVEY THAT MESSAGE IF IT MIGHT BE DONE WITHOUT OFFENCE TO THE DUKE SHE WAS THERE WITH THE OBJECT OF INGRATIATING HERSELF WITH THE DUKE
4959-28894-0038 SHE MUST NOT IMPEDE HER FAVOUR WITH THE DUKE BY MAKING HERSELF THE MEDIUM OF ANY SECRET COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN MARY AND HER LOVER BUT HOW SHOULD SHE SERVE TREGEAR WITHOUT RISK OF OFFENDING THE DUKE SHE READ THE LETTER AGAIN AND AGAIN
4959-28894-0039 AND THINKING IT TO BE A GOOD LETTER SHE DETERMINED TO SHOW IT TO THE DUKE MISTER TREGEAR HAS GOT IN AT POLPENNO SHE SAID ON THE DAY ON WHICH SHE AND THE DUKE HAD RECEIVED THEIR LETTERS SO I HEAR FROM SILVERBRIDGE
4959-28894-0040 IT WILL BE A GOOD THING FOR HIM I SUPPOSE I DO NOT KNOW SAID THE DUKE COLDLY HE IS MY COUSIN AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS WELFARE THAT IS NATURAL
4959-28894-0041 AND A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT WILL GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO DO CERTAINLY IT OUGHT SAID THE DUKE I DO NOT THINK THAT HE IS AN IDLE MAN TO THIS THE DUKE MADE NO ANSWER HE DID NOT WISH TO BE MADE TO TALK ABOUT TREGEAR
4959-28894-0042 MAY I TELL YOU WHY I SAY ALL THIS SHE ASKED SOFTLY PRESSING HER HAND ON THE DUKE'S ARM EVER SO GENTLY TO THIS THE DUKE ASSENTED BUT STILL COLDLY BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO DO
4959-28894-0043 WOULD YOU MIND READING THAT LETTER OF COURSE YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT FRANK AND I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP ALMOST AS BROTHER AND SISTER THE DUKE TOOK THE LETTER IN HIS HAND AND DID READ IT VERY SLOWLY
4959-28894-0044 WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT YOUNG MEN WITHOUT MEANS GOING INTO PARLIAMENT IS TRUE ENOUGH THIS WAS NOT ENCOURAGING BUT AS THE DUKE WENT ON READING MABEL DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO ARGUE THE MATTER
4959-28894-0045 HE HAD TO READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH TWICE BEFORE HE UNDERSTOOD IT HE DID READ IT TWICE AND THEN FOLDING THE LETTER VERY SLOWLY GAVE IT BACK TO HIS COMPANION WHAT OUGHT I TO DO ASKED LADY MABEL
4959-28894-0046 AS YOU AND I MY DEAR ARE FRIENDS I THINK THAT ANY CARRYING OF A MESSAGE TO MARY WOULD BE BREAKING CONFIDENCE I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO MARY ABOUT MISTER TREGEAR THEN HE CHANGED THE SUBJECT
